== List of contributors ==

* [https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/contributor-lists/akc-list.mediawiki Alex K. Chen]: Recruited in 2015; he has been working steadily with a specially negotiated deal that has minimum output requirements but additional pay based on pageviews and flexibility to create pages in addition to those that receive guaranteed payment. Has recruited other workers.

* [https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/contributor-lists/issa-list.mediawiki Issa Rice]: Recruited in 2015; work picked up in 2016. Also manages other workers, does underlying research and outreach.

Did solid work in May. Vacation in June, expected to return in July. Current focus: global health, but not necessarily the only focus in the long term.
