== List of contributors ==

* [Alex K. Chen](akc-list.mediawiki): Recruited in 2015; he has been working steadily with a specially negotiated deal that has minimum output requirements but additional pay based on pageviews and flexibility to create pages in addition to those that receive guaranteed payment. Has recruited other workers.

* [Issa Rice](issa-list.mediawiki): Recruited in 2015; work picked up in 2016. Also manages other workers, does underlying research and outreach.

* [Ethan Bashkansky](ethan-list.mediawiki): Recruited in 2016. Plays a key role in recruiting other workers.

* [Sebastian Sanchez](sebastian-sanchez-list.mediawiki): Recruited in April 2016 after the EA Forum blog post http://effective-altruism.com/ea/w5/looking_for_wikipedia_article_writers_topics/ -- already a friend of Vipul. Did solid work in May. Vacation in June, expected to return in July. Current focus: global health, but not necessarily the only focus in the long term.

* [Jesse Clifton](jesse-list.mediawiki): Recruited in April 2016 after the EA Forum blog post http://effective-altruism.com/ea/w5/looking_for_wikipedia_article_writers_topics/ Likely to work for a few months before starting graduate school. Sole focus: animal welfare. Steady output since recruited.

Grand total: Somewhere between $2850 and $4650 per month, median estimate $3400. In addition, $1250 per month deferred pay for Issa.

* Alex K. Chen: Payment handled annually, but approximately $100 per month for pageview-based payment, and approximately $250 to $500 for new page creation.

* Issa Rice: Approximately $800 per month on piece work (can vary from $600 to $1200), plus guaranteed retainer pay ($250 out-of-pocket, plus $1250 deferred), plus 10% or 15% commission on workers other than Sebastian, Jesse, and AKC (AKC payment is handed annually).
