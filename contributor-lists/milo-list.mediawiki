Not a Wikipedia editor. Work and payment structure complicated!

Some starting ideas. Three potential places to work: WikiHow, Subwiki, and Wikipedia. Wikipedia is highest in reach, but WikiHow and Subwiki allow for the creation of some kind of content that cannot be put on Wikipedia.


== Data analysis ==

=== WikiHow: Understand audience profile ===

See https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/understand-audience-profile.mediawiki and brainstorm on whether WikiHow articles can be constructed from it. Pay: About $200 for a high-quality article starting off from this. But less or more depending on exact scope of stuff.

== Economics ==

=== Market: Expand content ===

http://market.subwiki.org was something I started a while back for economic theory. Some of its pages are quite good, and I feel it can do with a lot of strategic expansion. It has about 20,000 pageviews a month, despite being pretty stagnant and having < 300 pages. It has a lot of potential.

Pay plan to be decided but this can be a good alternative to blogging for crystallizing economic insights in a form that can be used as a reference by future generations. Willing to pay up to $1000 for a series of improvements before next evaluation of further payment.


== Immigration and non-immigrant visas (United States): Mostly Wikipedia ==

Point(s) system (Canadian immigration law) -- similar page exists for UK, but nothing for Canada. Really??? $150

== Public choice ==

* Quadratic voting
