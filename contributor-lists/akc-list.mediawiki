List of bounty offers for Alex K. Chen (AKC).

For each, there is a "start by" date and a "finish by" date. The start
by date is to encourage a reasonable starting time and reduce the risk
of substantial conflict in our ideas of what exactly the page should
contain.

Wherever it says "(to be determined)" that means a candidate hasn't
yet been decided for the week. For each week, AKC is free to propose
candidates from within the long list below, or even some other
candidate, by the Tuesday before the deadline. Otherwise Vipul might
put in his own candidate by the end of Tuesday and AKC needs to finish
that.

At the end of each Sunday, AKC should have completed a total of at
least (number of weeks so far - 4) bounties. The "-4" is to account
for the fact that AKC expected January off. The "number of weeks so
far" is measured starting January 4, i.e., the end of January 10 marks
the end of the first week.

AKC can do multiple bounties a week, thereby building a surplus of
bounties completed, allowing him to take more time off later in the
year.
