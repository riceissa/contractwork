== Impact ==

=== Pageviews ===

Wikipedia Views links for tracking total pageviews of pages created:

* All time (includes pre-2016 pages): http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?tag=Pages%20created%20by%20Issa%20Rice&language=en&allmonths=allmonths

* Only 2016 (however, this also includes Form 1040, that was published on January 1, though included in 2015 payment): http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?tag=Pages%20created%20by%20Issa%20Rice%20in%202016&language=en&allmonths=allmonths

* Pages edited significantly but not created: http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?tag=Pages%20edited%20significantly%20but%20not%20created%20by%20Issa%20Rice&allmonths=allmonths

=== Anecdotal ===

* Howie Lempel (who works for the Open Philanthropy Project) was impressed with the page on the Open Philanthropy Project. He said that in some ways, the page does a better job of conveying what the Open Philanthropy Project has accomplished so far than the website  (with the caveat that both the Wikipedia page and the website only includes publicly available information, and therefore both are limited in accuracy and comprehensiveness).

* Scott Weathers liked the page on the timeline of global health

* Amy Zhang's high school teacher shared the timeline of global health with a UW professor. The timeline of global health was initially created by Issa and later improved upon by Amy.

* People at one of the orgs whose page Issa created offered to buy him drinks if he ever visited their location (note that they did not inappropriately influence the content of the page, beyond pointing to existing references and correcting errors backed by verifiable citations).

Total money earned by doing work (taxable as income for 2017): $1759.60

=== Open Phil and Good Ventures Wikipedia page grant list updates ===

For each month, the payment is calculated according to:

max{$27, min{$50, 5 * (1 + ''N'')}}

Here, ''N'' is supposed to represent number of new distinct grants. This is calculated as follows: at the end of each month, take the union of "all grants newly announced to the public by Open Phil during that month" and "all grants newly announced to the public by Good Ventures during that month". Then ''N'' is the number of grants in this set. Note that because Open Phil and Good Ventures do not immediately add grants to their databases as soon as they are made, the grants newly announced to the public during a month likely differ from the grants made during the same month.

=== Open Phil and Good Ventures Wikipedia page grant list updates ===
