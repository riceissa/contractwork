Potential ML/AI articles

There is a pretty comprehensive timeline of artificial intelligence, but more granular timelines can be helpful.

* Timeline of machine learning: Just a focus on the development of key ML concepts, algorithms, actual real-world implementations, etc.

* Timeline of speech and voice recognition

* Timeline of computer chess

* Timeline of autonomous vehicles

* Timeline of text and character recognition

Any particular conferences to cover?
