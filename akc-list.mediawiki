List of bounty offers for Alex K. Chen.

For each, there is a "start by" date and a "finish by" date. The start
by date is to encourage a reasonable starting time and reduce the risk
of substantial conflict in our ideas of what exactly the page should
contain.

Wherever it says "(to be determined)" that means a candidate hasn't
yet been decided for the week. AKC is free to propose candidates from
within the long list below, or even some other candidate, by the Tuesday before the deadline.

At the end of each Monday, AKC should have completed a total of at
least (number of weeks so far - 4) bounties. The "-4" is to account
for the fact that AKC expected January off.

AKC can do multiple bounties a week, thereby building a surplus of
bounties completed, allowing him to take more time off later in the
year.


* Start by January 8, finish by January 11: Timeline of online food delivery
* Start by January 15, finish by January 18: (to be determined by Tuesday January 12)
* Start by January 22, finish by January 25: (to be determined by Tuesday January 19)
* Start by January 29, finish by February 1: (to be determined by Tuesday January 26)

(more weeks, months to be added).

== Timeline pages ==

In general, for timeline pages, we expect about 1-5% of the pageviews
that we see for the corresponding page whose timeline page it is.

=== Technology ===

* Timeline of Amazon.com: The Amazon.com page gets 200K views a month,
  so we should expect 2K-10K pageviews per month. (Note that there is
  a lot of history on the main Amazon.com page, which should probably
  go in a separate History of Amazon.com page, but that's a separate
  thing you may want to do independently and I'm not attaching a
  bounty to that).

  Proposed bounty amount: $250 for a fairly comprehensive timeline
  page, less based on how much you cover.

* Timeline of Intel: The Intel page gets about 65K views a month, so
  we should expect 600-2500 pageviews per month.

  Proposed bounty amount: $150 for a fairly comprehensive timeline
  page, less based on how much you cover.

* Timeline of Microsoft: There is already a page on the history of
  Microsoft, but it would be interesting to do a timeline version
  thereof (which will have substantial overlap but still be structured
  differently and should add some value).

  Proposed bounty amount: $125 for a fairly comprehensive timeline
  that nonetheless adds value over and above the history page (and
  therefore survives deletion).

* Timeline of Instagram: The Instagram page gets 150K views a month,
  so we should expect 1.5-7.5K pageviews per month.

  Proposed bounty amount: $100

* Timeline of LinkedIn: The LinkedIn page gets 70K views a month, so
  we should expect 700-3500 pageviews per month.

  Proposed bounty amount: $75

* Timeline of Xiaomi: The Xiaomi page gets 40K views a month, so we
  should expect 400-2000 pageviews per month.
  
  Proposed bounty amount: $75

* Timeline of GitHub: The GitHub page gets 40K views a month, so we
  should expect 400-2000 pageviews per month.

  Proposed bounty amount: $50

=== Clothing retail ===

In addition to bounties below, extra $25 bounty for first clothing
retail page, as a reward for expanding your capability set.

* Timeline of Nordstrom: Nordstrom gets about 18K a month.

  Proposed bounty: $50

* Timeline of Forever 21: Forever 21 gets about 12K a month.

  Proposed bounty: $40

* Timeline of Saks Fifth Avenue: Saks Fifth Avenue gets about 10K a month.
  
  Proposed bounty: $35


== Philanthropy pages ==

* Open Philanthropy Project: Won't get many pageviews but of strategic
  importance.

  Proposed bounty amount: $100, can be done any time but should have
  substantive new content.
