This guide explores how to understand the way that your website's traffic varies over time, and how to use this information to better understand your website's users.

We consider how to separate periodic patterns (regularly repeating traffic patterns), one-off trends (such as a traffic change in response to a viral news event or social media post), random noise, and secular trends (long-term trends of change in the number of users). Even if you are interested in only one of these (such as secular trends) it is still important to get a rudimentary understanding of the others, so that you can filter them out to focus on what you care about.

We also consider different kinds of causes of traffic patterns, including push factors (such as Facebook posts or newsletters you send out) as well as pull factors (people searching for keywords that lead them to your site, or people directly visiting your website). The shape of traffic arising from push factors is quite different from that arising from pull factors.

We use data from Google Analytics (GA), Quantcast Measure (QM), and Facebook Insights (FBI), among other sources, to provide examples and benchmarks. All the data we discuss should be available within GA for your website.

== Steps ==
=== Understanding the limitations of using different timescales based on your traffic level ===
# The less traffic you have, the harder it is to do analysis at shorter timescales.
#* As a general statistical rule, random fluctation as a proportion of total traffic goes down as total traffic goes up, ''ceteris paribus'' (i.e., holding everything else constant).
#* In particular, for a site with very little traffic, it may only be possible to do analysis at a granularity of months, whereas for a site with a lot of traffic, it may be possible to do analysis at a granularity of hours.
# The extent to which your traffic fluctuates with viral news events also governs the feasibility of analysis at various timescales.
#* If traffic to your website is heavily influenced by viral news events (in the world) or the virality of specific posts you make to it, then analysis at short timescales may be hard. It may be necessary to use longer timescales to average out the variation in virality.
# Keep in mind that on longer timescales, it can be hard to separate periodic patterns from secular trends. Whereas the noise problem is taken care of at longer timescales, the separation of secular and periodic trends becomes harder. You need to explicitly consider the various kinds of traffic cycle (daily, weekly, and annual) in order to better predict patterns.

=== Understanding the different kinds of measurement and their relation ===

# Use traffic measurement including users, sessions, pageviews, and unique pageviews.
#* Users:
#* Sessions:
#* Pageviews:
#* Unique pageviews:
# 
=== Understanding the annual traffic cycle ===
# Identify the broad domain within which your website falls and how that might affect usage.
#* For instance, is your site primarily targeted at students, people in specific jobs, holiday activities, home improvement activities, or something else?
#* For the region and type of activity that your site is targeted at, what is the pattern of use through the year? For instance, if your site targets people at work in specific jobs, what are the lean seasons for that job?
# Use third-party tools to get a good baseline for seasonal fluctuation.
## Use Google Trends for seasonal fluctuation in keyword interest.
#* Use Quantcast data for the Stack Exchange in the subject closest to yours, where applicable, or any other site with publicly available Quantcast data. When using Quantcast data, it is generally preferable to look at data over 3 or more years, and pick websites that were not undergoing rapid growth (this is so that the pattern you see is, for the most part, the periodic trend rather than the secular growth trend). If you do have to use a site experiencing rapid growth as a benchmark, you will need to control for this growth (this requires some graph manipulation, whether mental or using a computer, so do it only if needed).
# Keep in mind some heuristics obtained from benchmark websites.
#* Academic websites targeted at the postsecondary level and getting a significant traffic share from the United States generally see a bimodal pattern. There is a traffic dip starting mid-December, with recovery starting mid-January, and continuing on until the end of April. Another dip begins in May till about the end of July, with recovery beginning in August and going on till December (with a brief dip for Thanksgiving). Note that the December dip (also known as the Christmas dip) is steep but brief whereas the dip seen between May and July (the summer dip) is less pronounced, but stretches over a longer time period.<ref name=quantcast-math-stackexchange>[https://www.quantcast.com/math.stackexchange.com Quantcast report for the Math Stack Exchange].

#* Websites targeted at professional audiences, or those that might be used by people at work or for work needs, generally see a Christmas dip worldwide, and additional dips at other times depending on the region of the world where their traffic comes from (for instance, those that get a large share of traffic from the United States see a Thanksgiving dip, albeit the dip duration is shorter than that of the Christmas dip). You can further isolate the effect of regional holidays on dips by filtering traffic by region. For instance, during the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States, traffic from the United States drops to weekend levels or even lower levels in the United States, but remains essentially uncharged in Europe and the rest of the world. Professional websites do see a ''very slight'' dip during the summer months, since people are more likely to take time off during these months (to coincide with their family members' time off from school). However, since not everybody takes time off at the same time, the dip is small and spread over a long time range.
#* Non-work sites, such as those related to home improvement or cooking, see a mild but brief Christmas dip, but no significant dip for other holidays. This is because the effect of reduced traffic due to some people taking time off is canceled by the effect of increased traffic due to some people doing special stuff for the holidays.

=== Understanding the weekly traffic cycle ===

# Use the general heuristic that traffic dips on weekends.
#* Depending on how worldwide your audience is, and your timezone, traffic will be least at the time that is the overlap of weekend time for all relevant timezones. If using UTC, you should expect traffic to start falling middle of Friday and rebound middle of Monday.
#* The general heuristic is that daily weekend traffic is about half of daily weekday traffic. However, you will need to adjust for the type of site you have, as discussed in the remaining steps.
# Keep in mind special rules that apply based on your type of website.
