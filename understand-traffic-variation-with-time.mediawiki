This guide explores how to understand the way that your website's traffic varies over time, and how to use this information to better understand your website's users.

We consider how to separate periodic patterns (regularly repeating traffic patterns), one-off trends (such as a traffic change in response to a viral news event or social media post), random noise, and secular trends (long-term trends of change in the number of users). Even if you are interested in only one of these (such as secular trends) it is still important to get a rudimentary understanding of the others, so that you can filter them out to focus on what you care about.

We also consider different kinds of causes of traffic patterns, including push factors (such as Facebook posts or newsletters you send out) as well as pull factors (people searching for keywords that lead them to your site, or people directly visiting your website). The shape of traffic arising from push factors is quite different from that arising from pull factors.

We use data from Google Analytics (GA), Quantcast Measure (QM), and Facebook Insights (FBI), among other sources, to provide examples and benchmarks. All the data we discuss should be available within GA for your website.

== Steps ==
=== Understanding the limitations of using different timescales based on your traffic level ===
# The less traffic you have, the harder it is to do analysis at shorter timescales.
#* As a general statistical rule, random fluctation as a proportion of total traffic goes down as total traffic goes up, ''ceteris paribus'' (i.e., holding everything else constant).
#* In particular, for a site with very little traffic, it may only be possible to do analysis at a granularity of months, whereas for a site with a lot of traffic, it may be possible to do analysis at a granularity of hours.
# The extent to which your traffic fluctuates with viral news events also governs the feasibility of analysis at various timescales.
#* If traffic to your website is heavily influenced by viral news events (in the world) or the virality of specific posts you make to it, then analysis at short timescales may be hard. It may be necessary to use longer timescales to average out the variation in virality.
# Keep in mind that on longer timescales, it can be hard to separate periodic patterns from secular trends. Whereas the noise problem is taken care of at longer timescales, the separation of secular and periodic trends becomes harder. You need to explicitly consider the various kinds of traffic cycle (daily, weekly, and annual) in order to better predict patterns.
# Use tools to control for weekly and annual cycles when trying to identify secular trends in traffic over several years.
#* One tool is to graph at the granularity over which you want to get rid of cycles. For instance, to get rid of weekly cycles, graph at a weekly granularity. To get rid of annual cycles, graph at an annual granularity. GA offers granularities of hourly (only if traffic is high enough), daily, weekly, and monthly. QM offers granularities of daily, weekly, and monthly.
#* Do comparison graphing between traffic at a given time and traffic that is one period (or an integer number of periods) behind. For instance, to adjust for the weekly cycle, graph traffic compared against a time period one week before. To adjust for both the weekly and annual cycles, graph traffic against a time period 52 weeks (or 364 days) ago. This is an integer number of weeks and is ''almost'' equal to a year so it does a good job. This feature is available in GA for your own site but not in the public-facing data for QM.
#* If you have flexibility to mathematically transform the data, you might want to consider moving-average graphs as well as graphs of difference relative to one period back (such as week-over-week growth, month-over-month growth, and year-over-year growth). Note that these options are not available in GA and QM.

=== Understanding the different kinds of measurement and their relation ===

# Use traffic measurement including users, sessions, pageviews, and unique pageviews.
#* Pageviews: This measures the number of times people open a page on the website.
#* Unique pageviews: This measures the number of times a visitor first visits a page. In particular, refreshes or revisits of the same page are not counted.
#* Sessions (also known as visits): This measures the number of times people visit a site. Every visitor must have at least one visit. The way an analytics tool separates sessions/visits for a single visitor from each other can vary based on the analytics tool. GA resets a session after about 25 minutes of inactivity.
#* Users (also known as visitors): This measures the number of distinct people who visited your website, as best as can be judged by the analytics service. Note that there is some ambiguity regarding the granularity at which users are deduplicated. For instance, if a user visits twice with a year of separation between the visits, is that user counted as a single user? Therefore, when reporting users, a granularity within which users are deduplicated is specified. For instance, if users are reported in terms of daily uniques (DU), then a user who visits multiple times in the same day is counted as a single user, but visits across days get added up. Similarly, weekly uniques (WU) and monthly uniques (MU) are also used. It's important to remember that weekly uniques would be ''less'' than the sum of daily uniques through the week.
#* Since calculating uniques across an arbitrary period is a computationally intensive process, the general practice with reporting uniques is to do so only for fixed time periods (such as daily, weekly, and monthly). For instance, QM reports uniques only for 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day periods.
# Use derived metrics to assess traffic quality.
#* Pageviews/user (also known as pages per visitor) and pageviews/session (also known as pages per visit) are the two common metrics. These numbers can range from 1 to about 20, with most websites seeing pageviews/session numbers between 1 and 4 and pageviews/user numbers between 1 and 8. As a general rule, higher values of pageviews/user or pageviews/session are considered "better" but there are many exceptions. For instance, for a transaction-based site, getting things done more quickly might mean a better user experience, so smaller values of pageviews/session might be better. Similarly, for a site that a user should ideally use once and then not need again, smaller values of sessions/user or pageviews/user may be better.
#* New versus returning users is also used. Note that it is not completely obvious whether a higher percentage of users who are new is a good or a bad thing. Rather, looking at the absolute numbers and trends for both is more helpful than simply looking at the percentage.
# Keep in mind the following correlational rules of thumb.
#* Pageviews, sessions, and users should generally go up and down in tandem. In other words, days when there are more pageviews will also be days when there are more sessions and days when there are more users.
#* However, the metrics will not necessarily change ''proportionally''. In other words, the pages/session and sessions/user metrics could fluctuate over time. In many cases, days with higher traffic see ''lower'' values of pages/session and sessions/user, because the extra traffic is more shallow and less loyal. In particular, for sites that have lower traffic on weekends than weekdays, pages/session is usually higher on weekends than weekdays. However, there are exceptions: in case of a viral and rapidly developing news event, pageviews/user can go up (as people keep poking around the site to find new coverage of the developing event). Also, on big holidays (as opposed to simply weekends), pageviews/session might go down along with overall pageviews if very little new content is being released.

=== Understanding the annual traffic cycle ===
# Identify the broad domain within which your website falls and how that might affect usage.
#* For instance, is your site primarily targeted at students, people in specific jobs, holiday activities, home improvement activities, or something else?
#* For the region and type of activity that your site is targeted at, what is the pattern of use through the year? For instance, if your site targets people at work in specific jobs, what are the peak seasons and the lean seasons for that job?
# Use third-party tools to get a good baseline for seasonal fluctuation.
#* Use Google Trends for seasonal fluctuation in keyword interest. Google Trends displays data at a monthly granularity since 2004. However, it only displays ''relative'' search interest, rather than absolute search volume. Therefore, it is not very good for identifying secular trends. But it can help with understanding seasonal variation.
#* Use QM data for the Stack Exchange in the subject closest to yours, where applicable, or any other site with publicly available QM data (note: ''only'' use sites that have verified Quantcast metrics, as indicated by the checkmark next to the site's name; data for other sites is too unreliable). When using QM data, it is generally preferable to look at data over 3 or more years, and pick websites that were not undergoing rapid growth (this is so that the pattern you see is, for the most part, the periodic trend rather than the secular growth trend). If you do have to use a site experiencing rapid growth as a benchmark, you will need to control for this growth (this requires some graph manipulation, whether mental or using a computer, so do it only if needed).
# Keep in mind some heuristics obtained from benchmark websites.
#* Academic websites targeted at the postsecondary level and getting a significant traffic share from the United States generally see a bimodal pattern. There is a traffic dip starting mid-December, with recovery starting mid-January, and continuing on until the end of April. Another dip begins in May till about the end of July, with recovery beginning in August and going on till December (with a brief dip for Thanksgiving). Note that the December dip (also known as the Christmas dip) is steep but brief whereas the dip seen between May and July (the summer dip) is less pronounced, but stretches over a longer time period.<ref name=quantcast-math-stackexchange>[https://www.quantcast.com/math.stackexchange.com Quantcast report for the Math Stack Exchange].

#* Websites targeted at professional audiences, or those that might be used by people at work or for work needs, generally see a Christmas dip worldwide, and additional dips at other times depending on the region of the world where their traffic comes from (for instance, those that get a large share of traffic from the United States see a Thanksgiving dip, albeit the dip duration is shorter than that of the Christmas dip). You can further isolate the effect of regional holidays on dips by filtering traffic by region. For instance, during the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States, traffic from the United States drops to weekend levels or even lower levels, but traffic remains essentially uncharged in Europe and the rest of the world. Professional websites do see a ''very slight'' dip during the summer months, since people are more likely to take time off during these months (to coincide with their family members' time off from school). However, since not everybody takes time off at the same time, the dip is small and spread over a long time range.
#* Non-work informational sites, such as those related to home improvement or cooking, see a mild but brief Christmas dip, but no significant dip for other holidays. This is because the effect of reduced traffic due to some people taking time off is canceled by the effect of increased traffic due to some people doing special stuff for the holidays.
#* Entertainment and gossip websites generally do not see a holiday dip. Some of them may even see a traffic increase during holidays, particularly if they cover feel-good stories and help people pass their vacation time. In general, their traffic pattern does not see a discernible annual cycles.
#* News sites generally do not have discernible annual patterns, but rather, their patterns are driven by the nature of events in that year. They may, in fact, even see patterns across time periods longer than a year. For instance, politics news sites see more traffic closer in time to elections, which may occur once every few years.
# Use age and gender filtering where relevant to verify initial hypotheses.

=== Understanding the weekly traffic cycle ===

# Use the general heuristic that traffic dips on weekends.
#* Depending on how worldwide your audience is, and your timezone, traffic will be least at the time that is the overlap of weekend time for all relevant timezones. If using UTC, you should expect traffic to start falling middle of Friday and rebound middle of Monday.
#* The general heuristic is that daily weekend traffic is about half of daily weekday traffic. However, you will need to adjust for the type of site you have, as discussed in the remaining steps.
# Keep in mind special rules that apply based on your type of website.
#* Websites related to outdoor activities can see more traffic during weekends than weekdays.
#* Websites related to cooking also see an increase in traffic toward the end of the week and during the weekend. The peak can vary between Thursday and Monday, with some websites seeing a peak during the weekend and others seeing a peak around Thursday and Friday.

=== Understanding the secular trends for your website ===

# Identify the various parameters that would affect the way your site would grow.
#* Secular trends for Internet access for your target audience
#* Secular trends for the domain or topic area: Some domains are experiencing overall growth, and if your site is in one of those domains, then it should grow organically as a result of that.
#* Age of your site: If your site is new, and people are gradually becoming aware of it through word of mouth, some growth will be powered by that.
#* Your promotional strategy
#* Search engine algorithm updates, and how these affect your search ranking
# Get benchmarks for secular trends in traffic for traffics similar to yours using QM.
#* A good global heuristic is that a lot of organic growth (due to expanding use of search and social media) occurred across many domains till late 2013 and early 2014, but Internet use (and in particular, web use as people have substituted away from the web more toward apps) has slowed down since then. Web use has flatlined in the United States and annual growth has slowed down in the rest of the world.<ref name=pew-home-broadband>[http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/21/home-broadband-2015/ Home Broadband 2015.

#* Technology-related Stack Exchange sites (such as StackOverflow and ServerFault) grew at a reasonable pace till around 2014, but since then have almost flatlined in the United States.
