=== Case details ===

The case involved Nishimura Ekiu, a 25-year-old female citizen of Japan who arrived on the steamship ''Belgic'' from [[Yokohama]] on May 7, 1891. William H. Thornley, commissioner of immigration of the state of California, refused to allow her to land. In a report on May 13, 1891, he elaborated on the reason for denying her entry: "Passport states that she comes to San Francisco in company with her husband, which is not a fact. She states that she has been married two years, and that her husband has been in the United States one year, but she does not know his address. She has $22, and is to stop at some hotel until her husband calls for her."
