A '''Public Access File''' is a file that any United States employer hiring people in [[H-1B visa|H-1B]], [[H-1B1 visa|H-1B1]], or [[E-3 visa|E-3]] temporary nonimmigrant worker statuses. It is intended to include more background information related to the attestations made on the [[Labor Condition Application]] used for the [[Form I-129]] and/or visa application that was used to acquire the nonimmigrant worker status.<ref name=murthy>{{cite web|url = http://www.murthy.com/2011/06/17/employer-public-access-file-requirements-for-h1b-h1b1-and-e-3-workers/|title = Employer Public Access File Requirements for H1B, H1B1 and E-3 Workers|date = June 17, 2011|accessdate = March 31, 2016|publisher = Murthy Law Firm}}</ref><ref name=olender>{{cite web|url = http://www.olender.pro/immigration/business-immigration/compliance/public-access-file|title = Maintaining the H-1B Public Access File|publisher= Olender Law Firm|accessdate = March 31, 2016}}</ref> The file may be requested by any member of the public through telephone or email inquiries, that should be responded to within 3 business days. It is distinguished from a Private Access File that might contain more sensitive and confidential employee data that must be shared with the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] or (other US government agencies?) if they choose to investigate.

== Contents of the file ==

=== Labor Condition Applications ===

The Public Access File should include the entirety of all Labor Condition Applications. (Is this relevant any more given that all LCAs are submitted online?)

=== Background information on the attestations made ===

The goal of the Public Access File is to provide more information explaining the basis of the attestations made in the [[Labor Condition Application]]. Below, we go over the list of the attestations made and any information that must be included in the Public Access File for those attestations.

=== Attestation #1: Wages ===

In the LCA, the employer must attest that the non-immigrant workers on behalf of whom the application is being made will be paid at or above both these numbers:

* The '''actual wage''': This is the wage paid to other employees in the company who do the same work.
* The [[prevailing wage]]: This is the wage for that occupation in the geographical area of intended employment.

The employer must make similar attestation regarding non-wage benefits offered.

The Public Access File must include documentation clearly explaining the following:

* A full, clear explanation of the system the employer used to set the "actual wage."
* A full, clear explanation of the system the employer used to set the "prevailing wage."

=== Attestation #2: Working conditions ===

In the LCA, the employer must attest that the hiring of non-immigrant workers will not adversely affect the working conditions of similarly employed workers at the company, and that the non-immigrant workers will be offered similar working conditions as native US workers. The Public Access File is not required to contain any particular mandatory information on working conditions (???).

=== Attestation #3: Strike, lockout, or work stoppage ===

In the LCA, the employer must attest that on the day the application is filed, there is not a strike, lockout, or work stoppage in the named occupation at the place of employment and that, if such a strike, lockout, or work stoppage occurs after the application is submitted, the employer will notify ETA within three (3) days of such occurrence and the application will not be used to file a work authorization petition until the ETA has determined that the work stoppage has ceased.

Documentation of such strikes, lockouts, or work stoppages, if they occurred, should be included in the Public Access File (???).

=== Attestation #4: Notice ===

In the LCA, the employer must attest that as of the date of application, notice of the application has been or will be provided both to workers within the company in the said application. Also, the (prospective) workers on whose behalf the application is filed must be provided a copy of the application.

The Public Access File must include proof of satisfying union/employee notification requirements. For non-union positions this means the posting notice.<ref name=olender/>

== Retention requirements == 

The PAF must be kept as long as the worker is employed in a status that depends on the corresponding LCA, and for one year after the worker is no longer in that status with the company.

== Penalties ==

- Required to produce file to member of the public within three days, or DOL.

- Failure to produce PAF quickly is itself compliance failure regardless of intent or any inaccuracy in LCA attestations.

- Past cooperation and compliance on PAF means less likely to be subjected to heavy penalties.
