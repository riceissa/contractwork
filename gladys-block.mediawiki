=== Block FFQ ===

During her time at the [[National Cancer Institute]] (1982 to 1991), Block developed a semi-quantitative [[food frequency questionnaire]] (FFQ) that would later come to be known as the Block FFQ.<ref name=D>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdenver.edu/research/CCTSI/programs-services/ctrc/Nutrition/Documents/Food_Frequency_Questionnaires.pdf|title = Food Frequency Questionnaires|accessdate = September 20, 2016|publisher = [[University of Colorado Denver]]}}</ref> This is the earliest of the currently widely used FFQs. Other FFQs include the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ) and NHANES (also developed at the National Cancer Institute) and the Harvard FFQ, developed by a team at [[Harvard University]] led by [[Walter Willett]].<ref name=D/><ref name=ffq-filter>{{Cite web|url = http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/diet/shortreg/register.php?format%5B%5D=ffq&numitems=any&size=any&age=any&gender=any&loc=|title = Register of validated short dietary instruments (restricted to FFQs)|publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]]}}</ref><ref name=dhq-1-research>{{cite web|url = http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/154/12/1089.full|title =Comparative Validation of the Block, Willett, and National Cancer Institute Food Frequency Questionnaires|last = Subar|first = Amy|last2 = Thompson|first2 = Frances|last3 = Kipnis|first3 = Victor|last4 = Midthune|first4 = Douglas|last5 = Hurwitz|first5 = Paul|last6 = McNutt|first6 = Suzanne|last7 = McIntosh|first7 = Anna|last8 = Rosenfeld|first8 = Simon}}</ref>

=== Vitamin C, dietary supplements, and their effects ===

While at the NCI, Block led research on the nutritional effects of the consumption of [[Vitamin C]] on health status and in particular cancer risk.<ref name=linkedin/> In a three-day symposium at the National Institutes of Health (September 10 to 12, 1990), Block summarized existing research on the role of Vitamin C in cancer prevention as follows: "Of 46 reports on epidemiologic studies, 33 described significant protective effects on cancer mortality or incidence."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/opinion/l-studies-confirm-pauling-on-vitamin-c-s-anti-cancer-benefit-080756.html|title = Studies Confirm Pauling on Vitamin C's Anti-Cancer Benefit|last = Lawson|first = Stephen|date = August 28, 1994|accessdate = October 24, 2016|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://americannutritionassociation.org/newsletter/vitamin-c-recognized-national-cancer-institute|title = Vitamin C recognized by the National Cancer Institute|publisher = NutritionDigest|accessdate = October 24, 2016}}</ref> 

Block continued to study the effect of vitamin and other nutrient consumption on health status while at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Her research results have generally supported the idea that vitamin consumption reduces the risk of adverse health conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and hypertension, and that dietary supplements can be an effective source of vitamins.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Usage patterns, health, and nutritional status of long-term multiple dietary supplement users: a cross-sectional study|journal = [[Nutrition Journal]]|date = October 24, 2007|accessdate = October 24, 2016|last = Block|first = Gladys|last2 = Jensen|first2 = Christopher|last3 = Norkus|first3 = Edward|last4 = Dalvi|first4 = Tapashi|last5 = Wong|first5 = Les|last6 = McManus|first6 = Jamie|last7 = Hudes|first7 = Mark|doi = 10.1186/1475-2891-6-30}}</ref> Block has been cited in media coverage of the debate around the efficacy of dietary multivitamin supplements.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/16/health/multivitamins-studies/|title = Are multivitamins a waste of money?
