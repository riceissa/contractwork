The [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] is a subdivision of the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] that adjudicates petitions and processes forms related to citizenship, residency, and various kinds of authorization to live and work in the [[United States]]. Many of the forms it processes are prerequisites for people outside the United States who are not United States citizens or permanent residents to obtaining visas to enter the United States in the specified status. Many of the [[USCIS immigration forms]] have long processing times. The USCIS offers some guidance regarding expected processing times through its website and through reports. This page describes the USCIS policies, the guidance they offer, and the courses of action in case of higher processing times.

== The USCIS processing queue ==

Each form or petition the USCIS receives is put in a [[queue]] for processing once it is received by the service center or branch office that will process it. The queue that a form is put in depends on two aspects:

* The service center or branch office where the form is being processed.
* The type of form (note that the form number alone does not determine the queue, because there may be many categories that use the same form number; for instance, [[Form I-129]] is used for many different kinds of temporary work authorization, and each of them has a separate queue).

The queue operates in a standard [[first in, first out]] fashion: a form that is put in the queue at a later date will start being reviewed or adjudicated at a later date (there is an exception for those who use the [[Premium Processing Service]] discussed later, that can be used for [[Form I-129]] and [[Form I-140]]). 

The time between the date of receipt of the form by the service center or branch office and the date it is reviewed is called the "processing time" of the form. Due to the way the queue operates, the processing times for forms processed close by in time will be similar. Therefore, to estimate processing times for forms that are currently being reviewed, it suffices to know the date of receipt.

=== Target processing times and backlogs ===

For each form, USCIS has a target processing time. If the processing time at a given time for a particular service center and form is significantly higher than the processing time, USCIS may either increase allocation of resources within the Service Center to process that form, or (in some extreme cases) reallocate some of the caseload to a different service center.
