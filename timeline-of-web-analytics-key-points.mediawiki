Guidance for creating this timeline, including some key steps.

== Kinds of tracking ==

=== Website-based ===

* First-party server logs, triggered through any web request regardless of whether the client can execute JavaScript.

* Third-party beacons (small snippets of code that load a third-party JS). Basic mechanism: a few lines of code in the raw HTML loads a JS file that executes various logic around tracking pageviews, user actions, etc. and sends them to the third-party server (API endpoint). Work only for JavaScript-executing user agents.

** Those that use only first-party cookies (cookies still stored under main domain, not third-party site) and cannot connect user activity across sites

** Those that use third-party cookies (cookies stored under third-party site) and can therefore connect user activity across sites

* Downstream logs, e.g., logs generated by specific actions such as purchases

=== User-based ===

* Browser toolbars, i.e., tracking tied to the user (rather than to the website) that users install (sometimes without full understanding of what they're installing). Used by Alexa, Quantcast, Google Toolbar (but not related to Google Analytics)

== Events ==

* Launch of Alexa, Compete, Quantcast, etc. and their audience panel approach (through browser toolbars) for user-level tracking

* Apache or whatever for web logs, log analysis softwares for that? (late 1990s/early 2000s?)

* Growth of JavaScript in browsers, leading to JavaScript-based third-party tracking pixels (what was the first?)

* Launch of Urchin (the original thing that became GA) and its initial feature set

* Google acquires Urchin, makes it Google Analytics, and makes it free for all

* Launch of website beacons by each of these services (for website-based tracking):

** Clicky Web Analytics
** Sitemeter
** Chartbeat
** Heap Analytics
** Alexa Certified Metrics (third-party cookie focus)
** Quantcast Measure (third-party cookie focus)

* Mobile web growth, effect on tracking if any

* Mobile apps, app analytics solutions

* Facebook launches retargeting pixels for audience analytics/targeting

== Measurement issues ==

=== Legitimate users not getting tracked ===

* Ad blockers and malware detectors/cleaners and their effect on analytics/tracking. Google Analytics and other trackers listed on EasyList Plus, blocked by uBlock; third-party cookie trackers listed on EasyList

* Any trends related to NoJS browsing?

=== Bot and spam problems ===

* Bot traffic
** Bots start executing JavaScript
** Lots of spam referrers etc. pollute Google Analytics data through a few different mechanisms

=== Sampling issues ===

* Google Analytics begins (?) sampling for large websites, limiting to 250K sessions

* Google Analytics Pro release, to allow unsampled data up to 10M sessions

== Changes to user details available ==

(I'm excluding launches of brand new analytics services here)

* Google Analytics gives website opt-in ability to join with
  DoubleClick cookie and infer gender, age, and interests data for
  users

* Increasing use of HTTPS and URL shorteners on the web makes referrers hard to track. Specifically the case for:
** Search traffic (no longer know search query)
** Social media traffic

* Google Analytics integrates with Google Webmaster Tools to get
  Google search impression and click data for searches leading to the
  site.

== Other changes to Google Analytics ==

* Google Analytics launches ability to send custom events

* Google Analytics launches A/B testing abilities

* Google Analytics change to Universal Tracking

* Google Analytics switches to new Analytics dashboard format

* Google Analytics starts showing realtime data; believed to be
  response to competition from Chartbeat

* Release of Google Surveys, incorporation into Google Analytics,
  Google Surveys is free when surveying about own site

== Other things ==

Use judgment on what and how much to include.

=== Website A/B testing tools ===

Kinda like analytics

* Optimizely

* MixPanel

* Apptimize

=== Backend analytics ===

* Loggly?

* Load balancer analytics and diagnostic tools

* Akamai, CloudFlare etc. provide DDoS protection, overall web analytics, anomaly detection

=== Optimization tools ===

Taboola, Outbrain etc that show recommendations

=== Offline metric integration ===

* Integrations of GA or other things with sending offline conversion data?

* Google incorporates store check-in data, uses to display popular times
