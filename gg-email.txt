Hi Jon,

I recently read your Giving Game Project Annual Report and that piqued my interest in Giving Games. That prompted me to read through the TLYCS website a little bit more (including http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Blog/ID/196/Can-Giving-Games-change-donor-behavior-We-did-an-experiment-to-find-out, http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Blog/ID/225/Tapping-Skeptic-Hearts-Through-Giving-Games and http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Blog/ID/198/Four-professors-on-the-pros-and-cons-of-Giving-Games) as well as Jeff Kaufman's post describing a Giving Game that he and his wife Julia ran.

After reading through the descriptions, I believe that people's thought processes in Giving Games might provide crucial information on their donation reasoning (both as it currently stands, and how it is influenced by discussion and exposure to the materials you have included). I've been looking for high-quality data on this, and so I was wondering if you would be in a position to share the post-game report data so that I could take a look. If you have confidentiality concerns around sharing the data for people who conducted GGs, I'm happy to write to the individuals who conducted GGs asking for their permission. 

After going through the reports, I'll be sure to share my takeaways with you. Also, if the findings are interesting enough and you agree, I'd also love to do a public writeup on it.

I'm also CCing Issa, who might collaborate with me on the analysis and writeup.

PS: You may remember me from Facebook discussions and past email correspondence regarding TLYCS's presence on Wikipedia.
