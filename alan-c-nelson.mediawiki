Nelson's years in the California state government were under the [[governorship of Ronald Reagan]], who would later nominate Nelson for the position of INS Commissioner.

Nelson had also worked along with [[Edwin Meese]] (counselor to President Reagan) in the office of the District Attorney of the County of [[Alameda, California]].

===1981 onward: work at the INS ===

In September 1981, Nelson moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] to assume the position of deputy commissioner of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Services]] (INS), to which he was appointed by then [[United States Attorney General]] [[William French Smith]]. At the time, INS had not had an appointed Commissioner since [[Leonel J. Castillo]]'s resignation in September 1979, and it had been run under Acting Commissioner [[David W. Crosland]] and later [[Doris Meissner]].<ref name=nyt-nomination/>

Reagan's first nominee for INS Commissioner had been [[Norman Braman]], but Braman withdrew his nomination in November 1981 citing his desire to spend more time on his automobile business in [[Florida]].
