When co-blogger Chris Hendrix <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/how-did-we-get-here-the-origins-of-immigration-restrictions-intro/">started off</a> a series a couple of years on the origins of immigration restrictions, he <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/how-did-we-get-here-the-origins-of-immigration-restrictions-the-chinese-exclusion-act/">fittingly began</a> with the Chinese Exclusion Act, looking at the arguments made for the act at the time. He looked at both the evidence available at the time and the evidence that has emerged since then, and examined the arguments made in light of that evidence. In a subsequent post in the series, I took a brief look at the <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/how-did-we-get-here-chinese-exclusion-act-implementation-1882-1910/">early years of the implementation of the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882-1910)</a>. While both these posts examined some aspects of the Chinese Exclusion Act in some detail, there is a lot about the history and aftermath of the Act that went unexplored.

Recently, I had the opportunity to create a number of Wikipedia pages on topics related to the Chinese Exclusion Act: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chae_Chan_Ping_v._United_States">Chae Chan Ping v. United States</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angell_Treaty_of_1880">Angell Treaty of 1880</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chy_Lung_v._Freeman">Chy Lung v. Freeman</a>, and others. As I worked on these pages, I familiarized myself more with the situation surrounding the Chinese Exclusion Act. I became increasingly convinced that a more in-depth look at the Chinese Exclusion Act would help shed light on the modern border control regime.

I therefore intend to do at least two more posts on the subject. The current post will focus on the key developments and tug-of-wars that occurred prior to the passage of the Act. The current post discusses the events leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, but differs from <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/how-did-we-get-here-the-origins-of-immigration-restrictions-the-chinese-exclusion-act/">Chris's post</a>. Chris's post was focused on the object-level argument, but the focus is different: my post focuses on the various axes of battle, so to speak, rather than the validity of arguments. It also goes back farther in history and pays particular attention to the state-level <a href="http://openborders.info/keyhole-solutions">"keyhole solutions"</a> used by state and local law enforcement in California before the federal government got on board with significantly restricting immigration. I discuss many (tentative) lessons and questions for the feasibility of migration liberalization that arise from this analysis.

In my very first post for <em>Open Borders: The Case</em>, I asked <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/why-was-immigration-freer-in-19th-century-usa">"Why was immigration freer in 19th century USA?"</a> At the time I postulated three broad categories of reasons: moral permissibility, technological feasibility, and desirability. The exploration in this post will help shed light on the relative balance of these reasons. Here's a summary:

<ul>
  <li>Moral permissibility appears to have been a non-issue in the minds of <em>most</em> people involved. But it weighed heavily on the minds of some influential people in the debate. Overall, the main difficulty with interpreting moral permissibility is that most people accepted the moral permissibility of governments having <em>some</em> authority to regulate immigration in the national interest, but there was little clear agreement on how expansively national interest was to be construed. While checks on government power were an idea that had been theoretically developed, the concept had not been developed well in practice. Insofar as permissibility issues arose, they had more to do with whether immigration policy was a federal or state matter.</li>
  <li>Desirability appears to have been the <em>primary</em> subject of most debate prior to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act.</li>
  <li>Technological feasibility probably played some background role in determining what immigration restrictions were even on the table. For instance, restrictions on immigration from Mexico or Canada did not receive any consideration until well into the 20th century, partly because of the technological infeasibility of restricting land immigration. However, it was not a primary point of debate in practice within the domain of restricting Chinese migration. Technological feasibility issues <em>did</em> become more central <em>after</em> the Act was passed, but in general the approach appears to have been to first pass a law (often one that was ambiguous both in what exactly it meant and how it would be enforced) and then "wing it" with respect to the enforcement details, passing amendments to close loopholes as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>First, they came for the Chinese</h4>

This post is focused on the history of the United States, but in preparation for it, I took a closer look at the development of immigration restrictions in other countries (John's post on <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/tearing-chestertons-fence-bigotry-border-controls/">tearing down Chesterton's fence</a> is a nice starting point, though there's more I had to look up). One of the things that struck me was that in at least two other English countries (Canada and Australia) the first significant immigration regulations appear to have been explicitly targeted at the Chinese, as I noted in an <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/openborders/permalink/913950588701663/">Open Borders Action Group post</a>.

The situation in Australia closely paralleled the situation with California. In both cases, large numbers of Chinese moved to the area around 1850 in search of gold. In both cases, resistance to Chinese started off with native miners and labor unions of "natives" (i.e., whites, rather than the indigenous population), but gradually spread to the rest of society. However, in the case of Australia, federal action on immigration occurred more quickly: the Immigration Restriction Act of 1855 imposed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Chinese_Australians#Immigration_Restriction_Act_.26_The_Walk_from_Robe">head tax on Chinese immigrants arriving at Victorian ports</a>. This keyhole solution led to a keyhole response: Chinese started arriving at ports where the head tax was not enforced, and then walking from there to the mining areas. This imperfect but still reasonably successful restriction on Chinese immigration would eventually be superseded by the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901, the act that marked the beginning of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Australia_policy">White Australia policy</a>. The chief difference between the cases of Australia and California appears to be that in the case of California, it took a couple decades between the point in time when there was state-level anti-Chinese sentiment to the point where there was sufficient political impetus for federal action.

The timeline of immigration regulation in Canada more closely parallels that of <em>federal</em> immigration regulation in the United States. The first significant restriction on Chinese immigration to Canada was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Immigration_Act_of_1885">Chinese Immigration Act of 1885</a> that, like Australia's first attempt at restriction, imposed a head tax on Chinese migrants. The head tax was increased over time until the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Immigration_Act,_1923">Chinese Immigration Act of 1923</a> that shut off immigration from China entirely. This is similar to the sequence of events in the United States: a Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that banned migration for Chinese laborers, followed with tightening and closing of loopholes over the next few decades.

Why did all three countries come for the Chinese first, before expanding to Asia, Africa, and "non-white" Europe? To some extent, the similarity in the evolution of immigration regulation can be traced to the political decision-makers in various countries taking cues from one another. However, I think the dominant factor here is that the Chinese were a unique group of migrants that had each of these features:

<ul>
	<li>Large population in a country suffering from various forms of war and despotism (the waves of migration to California and Australia occurred around the time of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion">Taiping Rebellion</a>), and therefore, large numbers of migrants.</li>
	<li>Very distinct in language and customs from the "natives" of the countries (i.e., whites), more so than people from non-English European countries, or even compared to Mexicans.</li>
	<li>Clearly foreign to the land, having come to it in large numbers over a short period of time, either voluntarily or as indentured laborers of various sorts. This put them in contrast with indigenous people (the true natives!). It also marked them somewhat distinctly from the population of African descent in the United States that, although non-white, had a substantial proportion that was either slaves or descendants of people who had been brought over as slaves. While immigration of free people of African descent would eventually get people in the United States and Australia, this took some time.</li>
	<li>Factors that tended to make Chinese migrants more noticeably successful and therefore a bigger threat to whites in the receiving countries.</li>
</ul>

<h4>It began in California</h4>

1848 was an important year for California for two distinct reasons. First, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War">Mexican-American War</a> concluded in February of this year. California had, since 1821, been part of Mexico, and it was as part of the Mexican-American War that Alta California (the northern part of California) was acquired by the United States in 1847. The southern part of California, Baja California, is still a part of Mexico. At the beginning of the year, San Francisco had a population of about 1,000, barely enough to be called a city.

Second, 1848 marked the beginning of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Gold_Rush">California Gold Rush</a>. Gold was discovered in California in January 1848. Initially, gold was so plentiful that mining it needed no special technology: early arrivals could simply retrieve gold by panning. As news of the discovery of gold spread, there was significant migration to California from the rest of the United States, other parts of Mexico, and China. As the low-hanging fruit started getting exhausted, it became harder and harder to make money off gold panning, and more sophisticated mining operations became necessary.

A lot has been written about the California Gold Rush, including its effect on how the American Dream is defined, the role of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_California_Gold_Rush">women</a>, and its importance for the development of California and its major cities. Miners formed alliances and rivalries of various sorts. One significant way miners got classified was based on their year of arrival (those arriving in 1848 were called forty-eighters, and those arriving in 1849 were called forty-niners). Race/ethnicity also played an important role in the alliances that would form. Whites had a bit of an upper hand, and state force was used to expel Native Americans (indigenous people) as well as the Mexican and Chinese miners.

The common narrative of immigration as strangers coming to an area where natives have been around for a while thus fails to describe the situation in California in many many ways:

<ul>
	<li>California was not even a part of the United States for that long before the first wave of Chinese migration. It was part of Mexico.</li>
	<li>If anybody could claim true native status, it was the indigenous Native Americans. They were, however, not treated well.</li>
	<li>As a matter of pure geography, at that time, the journey from China to California took less time than the journey from the eastern United States (this was before the development of rapid transport across the United States).</li>
	<li>The vast majority of immigrants to California were Americans, and for urban centers such as California, the population of natives that existed prior to 1848 was negligible.</li>
</ul>

With that said, California got something critical from being part of the United States: an Anglo-American set of institutions and legal traditions (albeit one marred in many ways).
