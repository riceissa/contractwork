<p>This is an online portal with a summary and various exploration options for contract work done for <a href="https://vipulnaik.com">Vipul Naik</a>. The git repository with the code for this portal, as well as all the underlying data (with the exception of private payments, that account for about 1% of total payments), is <a href="https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork">available on GitHub</a>. All payment amounts are in current United States dollars (USD).</p>
<p><strong>Starting March 8, 2017, all aspects of contract work that involve editing Wikipedia are suspended until further notice.</strong> Prior to this, Vipul Naik received no third-party payment to finance the contract work, and in particular, the Wikipedia portion of it. The suspension is due to the contract work coming under scrutiny at Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard&oldid=769384347">Conflict of interest/Noticeboard</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents#Vipul.27s_paid_editing_enterprise">Adminstrators' Noticeboard/Incidents</a>. If you have questions, please get in touch with Vipul Naik. Once the discussion is wrapped up, more information will be posted here.</p>
<p>From May 2017 onward, some contract work listed here, primarily on the <a href="https://timelines.issarice.com">Timelines wiki</a>, will be sponsored by <a href="/payer.php?payer=Peter+Hurford">Peter Hurford</a>. Individual tasks sponsored by Peter Hurford are explicitly listed as such.</p>

<p>For the sake of full transactional transparency, you can compare the record of payments made below here with a full transaction history: <a href="https://files.vipulnaik.com/accounts/transaction-history.html">bank account</a> and <a href="https://files.vipulnaik.com/accounts/paypal-transaction-history.pdf">PayPal</a> (these were last updated March 5, 2017). In particular, you can get a better sense of the cash flow of the operation, and verify all the claims made here regarding payments (as well as the lack of any payments received by Vipul Naik for this project).</p>
