This guide covers the basics of online survey design, response collection, and analysis. It's not a how-to for the steps associated with any specific survey tool. Rather, it provides a general framework that will help select and use the best survey creation and survey distribution tools for your purpose.

== Steps ==

=== Understanding the Overall Steps ===

# Keep in mind the three main steps of using online surveys.
#* Survey design: This means creating the survey. It includes the selection of questions, selection of question order, selection of answer formats (e.g., free-form versus multiple-choice), and selection of design logic.<ref name=pew-questionnaire-design>[http://www.pewresearch.org/methodology/u-s-survey-research/questionnaire-design/ Questionnaire design], Pew Research Center</ref> It also includes the selection of the survey design tool.
#* Response collection: This means getting people to respond to the survey. When the total audience that you are trying to reach is small and responsive, this step is simple: you just ask them to fill in the survey. If, however, you want to get information about a large population that can't easily be reached, you'll need to find ways to properly ''sample'' from that large audience.
#* Data analysis: This involves looking at the survey responses and figuring out the answers to the questions that motivated you to make the survey in the first place.
# Keep in mind the dependencies between the selection of tools for these purposes.
#* In ''principle'', the steps are independent: you could use one tool for survey design, another tool for response collection, and a third tool for data analysis. In practice, there are limitations that they place on each other.
#* Some survey collection tools ''require'' the survey to be hosted on the associated survey design platform. For instance, if using Google Consumer Surveys for response collection, you have to host the survey on Google Consumer Surveys. Similarly, if using SurveyMonkey Audience for response collection, you have to host the survey on SurveyMonkey. On the other hand, you can use Amazon Mechanical Turk to get responses to surveys hosted elsewhere: you just have to tell the Mechanical Turk participants to go to the survey link.
#* Conversely, some survey design tools only allow for response collection through the associated response collection tool. For instance, if you design a survey in Google Consumer Surveys, you can only direct responses to it through Google Consumer Surveys. On the other hand, surveys designed using SurveyMonkey can be distributed both through SurveyMonkey Audience and to your own selected audiences through the sharing of web links (with multiple collectors possible on a single survey).
#* Survey analysis can usually be done on the survey design platform itself. Many survey design platforms offer the option of exporting the survey results in formats such as the computer-friendly CSV format. You can process these exports through your own data analysis tools. However, the latter might require the expertise of a data scientist. Thus, much of your analysis of survey results is likely to be on the survey design platform itself.
# Keep in mind the interaction with your budget and goals. To use the right survey solution in a cost-effective way, you need to juggle a lot of different things. This guide will prepare you!
#* You need to have a good idea of the goals you wish to accomplish.
#* You need to have reasonable familiarity with survey design (something you will hopefully have after reading this guide). In cases where your target audience is too huge to survey completely, you'll also need the right statistical intuition and tools to interpret the results.
#* You need to know what your budget is. This becomes important when you are trying to reach reasonably representative samples of large target audiences.
#* You need a good mental model of the dependencies between the different components.

=== Selecting a Survey Design Tool ===

# Keep in mind the different functionalities offered by a survey design tool.
#* A survey design tool makes it easier for you to construct survey questions. Rather than write code to describe all the logic, you can select from pre-existing templates and designs. 
#* Some survey design tools also provide intelligent guidance on how to make your survey questions more statistically reliable.
#* The survey design tool also generally ''hosts'' the survey, and stores both the actual survey and all response information to the survey.
#* The survey design tool might have associated response collection tools (for instance, survey design tool SurveyMonkey has associated response collection tool SurveyMonkey Audience). Alternatively, it might simply allow you to generate a weblink that you can circulate to the desired survey audience. Some tools offer both.
#* The survey design tool provides some rudimentary online analysis of the survey results, and also allows you to download and export the responses. Typical download formats include comma-separated values (CSV), Microsoft Excel (XLS or XLSX), and Portable Document Format (PDF).
#* It is possible to imagine in principle that the actual question design part and the hosting part are completely separate: you can design a survey in one tool and then host it and collect responses on a different tool. However, in practice, most of the leading survey design tools combine both functions. Part of the reason is that online surveys involve reasonably complex web logic for which there is no global standard specification, and each tool differs somewhat in the capabilities it supports. So, you cannot upload a survey from one tool to another.
# Keep in mind the following limitations placed by your survey design tool.
#* Some survey design tools, such as Google Forms, ''only'' allow web links, and don't directly integrate with response collection.<ref name=google-forms-response-collection>[https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2917686 Choose a form response destination], Google Support, September 24, 2016</reF> That means that response collection is ''your'' job: you'll need to take the web link and circulate it through your own distribution channels.
#* Survey design tools may not support features you care about: question types you want to use, branching and skip logic, ability to edit questions after the survey has started, ability to maintain multiple collectors for a single survey, integration with data analysis capabilities, unlimited responses, and data export capabilities. Some design tools (such as SurveyMonkey) offer some of these features in the free version, but restrict other, more advanced features to the paid version.<ref name=surveymonkey-pricing>[https://www.surveymonkey.com/pricing/upgrade/details/ SurveyMonkey Pricing]</ref>
# Use existing online comparisons of survey design tools. The Wikipedia page comparing survey software provides a starting point of a list.<ref name=wikipedia-comparison>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_survey_software Comparison of survey software], Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, retrieved September 24, 2016</ref> Some of the most common survey design tools, and their key advantages and limitations, are discussed below.
#* Google Forms has some advantages: it is free and offers unlimited responses and integration with Google Sheets (that can then be exported to Excel, CSV, or PDF) for response analysis.<ref name=google-forms-response-collection/> It is also possible to create reasonably complex surveys and question types.<ref name=google-forms-create-survey>[https://support.google.com/docs/answer/87809?hl=en&ref_topic=6063584 Create a survey using Google Forms], Google Support, retrieved September 24, 2016</ref> It can be an ideal situation for a reasonably simple survey, and may be the best free tool available if you're getting over 1000 responses. One key ''disadvantage'' is a lack of integration with any response collection methods: you're basically left to your own devices for getting respondents.<ref name=google-forms-response-collection/>
#* SurveyMonkey has many pricing tiers starting with free (the BASIC plan).<ref name=surveymonkey-pricing/> If your surveys have a linear flow (no skip logic or branching) and you don't expect over 100 responses per survey, the free version is good enough for you. Integration with SurveyMonkey Audience for response collection is a helpful feature (although SurveyMonkey Audience costs money every time you use it, it can be used with the free version of SurveyMonkey). As soon as you want to start using advanced features (skip logic, over 100 responses, data exports, multiple filters, and more), you have to start paying, and the cheapest paid plans start at $26/month or $300/year. It is usually easy to switch down from paid to free, and you can continue to access past survey responses with over 100 responses.<ref name=surveymonkey-downgrading>[http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Downgrading Downgrading to a BASIC Plan], SurveyMonkey, retrieved September 24, 2016</ref> One key ''disadvantage'' is that data export isn't available in the free version, though you can still make publicly shareable online links. But it means you are tied to the online platform unless you pay for at least one month, or manually copy over the data. The other key disadvantage is the inability to get over 100 responses per survey, which can be an issue since you may need more than that many responses to get your entire target audience, or a large enough sample.<ref name=surveymonkey-sample-estimation>[http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/SurveyMonkeyArticleType/How-many-respondents-do-I-need Calculating the Number of Respondents You Need], SurveyMonkey, retrieved September 24, 2016</ref><ref name=surveymonkey-significant-differences>[http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Significant-Differences Statistical Significance], SurveyMonkey, retrieved September 24, 2016</ref>
#* Google Consumer Surveys is a survey design tool you can use for short surveys. It is ideal for surveys with only one question. The main distinguishing feature of Google Consumer Surveys as a survey design tool is that it's tied to Google Consumer Surveys for survey distribution: to use one, you must use the other!
#* Survata is a survey design tool with a similar model as Google Consumer Surveys: it is tied to its own distribution mechanism for the surveys.(citation needed)
#* Facebook Polls is a survey design tool for creating surveys on Facebook. These can be circulated through Facebook the way Facebook posts usually circulate (with the circulation limited by the privacy settings of the poll and/or the group or page it was posted in). In addition, you can link to the poll from elsewhere to invite others to participate in it.<ref>[https://apps.facebook.com/my-polls Facebook Polls], retrieved September 24, 2016</ref>
#* Other survey solutions worth looking into include Qualtrics and SurveyGizmo.<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/MONEY/usaedition/2012-08-28-Efficient-Small-Business-Ecommerce_CV_U.htm Customer research easier in digital era], Scott Martin, ''USA Today'', August 28, 2012</ref><ref name=wikipedia-comparison/>

=== Designing the Survey ===

# For any individual question, choose carefully whether you'd like to use a closed-ended format (such as multiple-choice) or open-ended format.
