This repository contains details of contract work sponsored by Vipul Naik. The repository was officially created as a separate repository on Friday, December 9, 2016, forked from [working-drafts](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts).

See the [contributor cover summary](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/contributor-cover-summary.mediawiki) for more details.

For a usable interface to understand all the contract work so far, see [Contract Work for Vipul Naik](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com). The underlying code for that is in the [access-portal folder](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/tree/master/access-portal/) in this Git repository.

If you are a new contributor or contract worker who works on Wikipedia content creation, make sure to read Issa Rice's [Memo for Wikipedia editors who are starting](https://exp.issarice.com/wikipedia.html).
