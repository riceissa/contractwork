This repository contains details of contract work sponsored by Vipul Naik. The repository was officially created as a separate repository on Friday, December 9, 2016, forked from [working-drafts](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts).

See the [contributor cover summary](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/contributor-cover-summary.mediawiki) for more details. We will shortly be releasing a web interface to more interactively view the history of grants and the impact they've had.
