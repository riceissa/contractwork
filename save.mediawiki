'''Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements''' (SAVE) is a program managed by [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS), a branch of the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS). SAVE facilitates lookups on the immigration and nationality status of individuals in the [[United States]].<ref name=uscis-save>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/save|title = SAVE|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = May 13, 2016}}</ref> It is an intergovernmental initiative designed to help federal, state, tribal, and local government agencies, or by a contractor acting on the agency's behalf, to determine eligibility for benefits, licenses or grants, government credentials, or to conduct background investigations.<ref name=save-pia>{{cite web|url = https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_pia_uscis_save.pdf|title = Privacy Impact Assessment for the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program|date = August 26, 2011|accessdate = May 13, 2016|publisher = [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]|last = Jackson|first = Janice|last2 = Hawkins|first2 = Donald|last3 = Callahan|first3 = Mary Ellen}}</ref><ref name=lii>{{cite web|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/7/272.11|title = 7 CFR 272.11 - Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program.|publisher = [[Legal Information Institute]]|accessdate = May 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=uscis-telecon>{{cite web|url = https://www.dhs.gov/telecon-recap-immigration-status-verification-drivers-licenses-public-benefits-and-social-security|title = Telecon Recap: Immigration Status Verification for Drivers' Licenses, Public Benefits, and Social Security Cards: A Conversation with USCIS|publisher = [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]|accessdate = May 13, 2016}}</ref> It is one of two programs that uses the [[Verification Information System]] (VIS).

== Permissible uses and users ==

SAVE can be used by agencies of governments at any level in the United States, including:<ref name=save-pia/>

* The federal government
* State governments
* Local governments (such as city and county governments)
* Tribal governments

A given agency is eligible to use SAVE only if determining the immigration and nationality status of individual is necessary for its work of one of these types:<ref name=save-pia/>

# Determination of eligibility for a federal, state, or local public benefit
# Issuing a license or grant
# Issuing a government credential
# Conducting a background investigation
# Any other lawful purpose

In addition to these, any contractor of an agency of the above description is eligible to use SAVE if the task contracted out to them requires immigration and nationality lookups for one of the above reasons.<ref name=save-pia/>

SAVE does not itself make determinations regarding the applicant's eligibility for a benefit or license.<ref name=save-pia/><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.tdhca.state.tx.us/community-affairs/docs/SAVEWebinarSlides.pdf|title = Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program|date = April 19, 2016|accessdate = May 13, 2016|publisher = Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs}}</ref><ref name=ipc-save-factsheet>{{cite web|url = http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/systematic-alien-verification-entitlements-save-program-fact-sheet|title = The Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program: A Fact Sheet|publisher = [[Immigration Policy Center]]|accessdate = May 13, 2016}}</ref> Rather, it simply provides an easy way to pull information about the benefit or license applicant from a variety of government databases. As discussed later, the absence of matching records in SAVE does not imply that the applicant's presence in the United States is unauthorized, or that the applicant is ineligible for the benefit. It simply means that the records accessible were not able to confirm the applicant's eligibility.<ref name=ipc-save-factsheet/>

== Usage by customer agencies ==

The general way SAVE is used is as follows. The noncitizen first submits all the necessary documentation based on the eligibility criteria for the program he or she is applying to (these eligibility criteria can vary based on the person's immigration status, the state, and the program being applied to). If this documentation in principle demonstrates the applicant's eligibility, then the caseworker at the agency can use SAVE to verify that the documentation is accurate. If Initial Verification fails, then the caseworker can (and must, if the applicant wants) submit the case for Additional Verification and then, if necessary, submit Form G-845. If the verification fails to demonstrate the validity of the documentation provided by the applicant, the applicant is not granted the benefit. The caseworker cannot use this failure to conclude that the applicant is lying about his/her status, or to use it to report the applicant to [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]].<ref name=ua-rtip/><ref name=dpaweb/>

=== Modes and stages of verification using SAVE ===

SAVE has three modes of electronic access that offer all of its basic functionality.<ref name=save-verification-process/><ref name=ua-rtip/>

* Web-based access, through the USCIS website accessed through a secure web browser<ref name=save-login/>
* Web services, an interface that uses a direct machine-to-machine connection
* SAVE via AAMVAnet (VLS), available to [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] in US states

SAVE allows for three levels of verification for those using the system electronically.<ref name=save-pia/><ref name=dpaweb>{{cite web|url = http://dpaweb.hss.state.ak.us/manuals/admin/105/105-14.htm|title = 105-14  SYSTEMATIC ALIEN VERIFICATION FOR ENTITLEMENTS - ELECTRONIC VERIFICATION PROCESS|publisher = DPA Web|accessdate = June 5, 2016}}</ref><ref name=save-verification-process>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/save/getting-started/save-verification-process|title = SAVE Verification Process|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = June 5, 2016}}</ref><ref name=ua-rtip>{{cite web|url = http://ua-rtip.org/sites/ua-rtip.org/files/Christal_Gainyard.pdf|title = Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program|accessdate = June 11, 2016|publisher = Race Track Industry Program}}</ref>

|}

In addition, there is also an option of ''pure'' paper-based verification, where the agency directly submits a paper Form G-845, and gets a response within 10 to 20 federal government work days. This costs the customer agency $2, compared to the total maximum charge of $1.50 if initiating the query electronically. However, this option is discouraged since the use of electronic means for Initial Verification saves time and money for all parties involved.<ref name=save-verification-process/>

==== Initial Verification ====

For Initial Verification, the authorized caseworker of the customer agency needs to first log in to SAVE through the Verification Information System, after agreeing to the terms and conditions of usage.<ref name=save-login>{{cite web|url = https://save.uscis.gov/web/vislogin.aspx?JS=YES|title = Sign In, Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements|accessdate = June 5, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}</ref><ref name=dpaweb/> The caseworker may then choose the "Initiate Cases" tab, enter relevant information about the applicant whose status needs to be checked, and submit it. If matching records are found in the databases available to SAVE, these are returned. Some of these records may contain photos, which are also included in the response. The caseworker can respond whether the photo matches the corresponding photo submitted by the applicant or any other applicant photo. Only information related to the applicant is returned in the Initial Verification.<ref name=dpaweb/>

The Initial Verification process generally takes a few minutes (the actual search itself takes 3 to 5 seconds).<ref name=save-verification-process/> The case is kept open for 180 days (so the caseworker can access the case details at any time till then, and print out if needed) after which it are closed if no action is taken during that time.<ref name=dpaweb/>

==== Additional Verification ====

If the Initial Verification provides the caseworker with all the information needed to confirm the applicant's documentation, then no additional work needs to be done. However, an Additional Verification may be instituted (electronically, through the SAVE interface) in one of these two cases:<ref name=save-pia/><ref name=dpaweb/>

* SAVE is unable to find a record pertaining to the applicant. In this case, SAVE suggests to the caseworker to institute an Additional Verification. The caseworker is required to inform the applicant that SAVE returned this message, and if the applicant wants an additional verification, then the caseworker is required to institute it.<ref name=save-pia/>
* The caseworker or applicant has concerns about the information returned in the initial verification. In this case, the caseworker can requests an Additional Verification (even though SAVE does not prompt the caseworker to do so).

Additional Verification can take 3 to 5 government work days.<ref name=dpaweb/> This step involves USCIS Immigration Status Verifiers making more sophisticated queries to various databases (including DHS systems and DOJ's EOIR system), to locate the applicant's records. Status Verifiers have read-only access to information contained in many other systems through the Person Centric Query System. Once the Status Verifiers have completed their search, the information is returned electronically to the caseworker through the SAVE interface.<ref name=save-pia/>

==== Form G-845, Document Verification Request ====

If the Additional Verification fails to turn up any information, or if the Status Verifier detects discrepancies that can only be resolved by examining the applicant's documentation, SAVE provides an electronic notification to the caseworker and recommends that the caseworker submit Form G-845, Document Verification Request, with a copy of the applicant's immigration documentation. An already-filled electronic form is made available to the caseworker, who needs to print and mail it to the USCIS Immigration Status Verification Unit.<ref name=dpaweb/>

If the caseworker submits these documents, Status Verifiers conduct a more thorough search using PCQS, and may also request record corrections to the USCIS Central Index System (CIS) database by contacting the USCIS Records Division.<ref name=save-pia/> A response should generally be returned within 20 federal working days, which is usually about one calendar month. If USCIS does not respond within that time, the caseworker can call the USCIS toll-free number to inquire into the status of the case.<ref name=dpaweb/>

=== Cost structure for customer agencies ===

Customer agencies are charged on a per-query basis, with a cost of $0.50 each for initial verification, retry, and additional verification, and a cost of $2.00 for a paper G-845 if the verification process is not initiated electronically. Billing is monthly, and there is a minimum monthly service transaction charge of $25.00 if the SAVE program is used at all, any time within the month. There is no charge during months when SAVE is not used at all. This pricing structure for SAVE has been effective since October 1, 2008.<ref name=save-cost-structure/> Billing is done by the USCIS's Burlington Financial Center, and methods of payment include credit card and check.<ref name=ua-rtip/>

=== Obligations of customer agencies as agreed upon while using SAVE ===

For a customer agency to sign up to use SAVE, the agency must agree to SAVE's Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Computer Matching Agreement (CMA). This covers a range of topics:

# The customer agency agrees to responsibilities regarding safe handling of information, minimum security standards for electronic transmissions, and breach incident notification. These provisions are compliant with requirements of the [[Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002]] (FISMA), relevant [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) guidance, and the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] Sensitive Systems Policy 4300A.<ref name=save-pia/>
# The customer agency agrees to various other obligations around the use of stages of verification. For instance, if the initial verification turns up no response, or if the information is inconsistent with what the applicant submitted, the agency must inform the applicant, and, if the applicant wishes to undergo additional verification, the agency must request additional verification.
# The customer agency agrees to limit its determination of the applicant's immigration and nationality status to the limited purposes necessary for determining eligibility for the benefit. 

Specific USCIS guidance on (3) is included below.<ref name=dpaweb/>

For applicants for the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP; colloquially called "food stamps"):

* The caseworker will not determine that a household member is ineligible to receive food stamps because that person is in the U.S. illegally unless specific documentation is provided showing illegal status.
* A caseworker must never assume that a household member is in the U.S. illegally if they fail to provide documentation of their legal status. 
* A report will not be made to the local USCIS office if the caseworker determines the alien is ineligible to receive benefits because the alien failed to provide documentation showing proof of legal status in the U.S.
* If the caseworker receives a confession from a household member that they are in the U.S. illegally, the caseworker will determine that the household member is ineligible to receive food stamps only if there is documentation that supports the confession. If there is no documentation that supports the confession, the caseworker will require the household member to provide documentation of legal status. If the household member does not provide the documentation, deny benefits for the household member for which information was not received.
* A report will be made to the local USCIS office only if a confession from the alien is received that they are in the U.S. illegally and there is documentation that supports the confession.

For applicants for other programs:

* If an applicant fails to provide proof of legal alien status for a member of the household, the caseworker will not make any further investigation of the household member’s legal status.
* If an applicant fails to provide documentation of legal alien status for a member of the household, the caseworker will consider the household member ineligible for public assistance due to failure to provide documentation of legal alien status.
* Since the caseworker did not determine the household member ineligible for benefits due to their illegal status, the household member will not be reported to USCIS.

=== Programs for which the use of SAVE is mandated ===

The use of SAVE is governed by a number of federal and state rules, with some rules requiring the use of SAVE for some purposes, and other rules restricting the usage of SAVE and putting limits on the way customer agencies can use the information obtained from SAVE. Note that SAVE does not usually contain information about people who were citizens since birth.<ref name=save-pia/> It also does not offer any conclusive information regarding immigration status, but is simply a tool that helps verify documentation of status that a person submits.<ref name=ipc-save-factsheet/>

Below is a list of programs and the status of using SAVE for them. As a general rule, SAVE is used to verify the immigration status ''only'' for people who do not claim to be citizens of the United States. It is not generally used to verify citizenship status for either birthright citizens or naturalized citizens, even though SAVE usually contains information for naturalized citizens.<ref name=save-governing-laws>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/save/about-save-program/save-governing-laws|title = SAVE Governing Laws|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|date = March 20, 2014|accessdate = June 6, 2016}}</ref> In the table below, "eligible at state option" means that individual states can set rules around eligibility within that category, i.e., they can choose to either provide the benefit or deny it.

SAVE arose as a result of a mandate in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. According to this act, agencies participating in the following programs are required to use SAVE to verify documentation of eligibility for the following programs:


* [[Temporary Assistance to Needy Families]], [[Medicaid]] ([[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]])
* [[Unemployment Compensation Program]] ([[U.S. Department of Labor]])
* Title IV Educational Assistance Programs ([[U.S. Department of Education]])
* Some housing assistance programs ([[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]])


== Services for applicants ==

The SAVE program allows applicants for whom a verification has been initiated and is pending to check the status of their verification online, using SAVE CaseCheck through a web browser. To verify identity, the applicant needs to fill in information similar to that needed to initiate a verification, as well as the verification case number. Note that only existing pending verifications can be looked up using SAVE CaseCheck. It is not possible for a prospective applicant to use this feature preemptively, before a verification is initiated by the agency using SAVE.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/save/save-case-check|title = Welcome to SAVE CaseCheck|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|date = February 18, 2016|accessdate = June 5, 2016}}</ref><ref name=studyinthestates>{{cite web|url = https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/2015/09/uscis-explains-the-save-program|title = USCIS Explains The SAVE Program|date = September 22, 2015|accessdate = June 5, 2016|publisher = Study in the States, [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]}}</ref>

SAVE also provides guidance to benefits applicants regarding what USCIS or CBP agencies to contact to request corrections in the records that SAVE uses for verification.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/save/benefit-applicants/questions-about-your-records|title = Questions About Your Records?|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|date = April 8, 2015|accessdate = June 5, 2016}}</ref>

== Data sources used ==

=== Sources used for the Verification Information System used for Initial Verification ===

The Initial Verification, which is the first step in using SAVE electronically, queries the SAVE system, which is updated daily through downloads from a number of agencies operating under the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]].

=== People covered and not covered under SAVE ===

SAVE can be used to get information supporting the veracity of documents and status claims for naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents who are not citizens, and people in various non-immigrant statuses.<ref name=save-pia/>

Applicants who are United States citizens since birth usually have no presence in any of the databases accessible to SAVE, although those who have renounced their citizenship, or have otherwise come in contact with immigration enforcement may have some available data. For this reason, the absence of matching records found by SAVE cannot be used to rule out the possibility that somebody is a United States citizen.<ref name=save-pia/>

=== Data not returned to the customer agency ===

Based on a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the DHS and the [[U.S. Department of State]], passport numbers are not included in the information returned to customer agencies using SAVE. However, the data is available to Status Verifiers when using the PCQS during the first Additional Verification stage or while doing the final verification based on Document G-845.<ref name=save-pia/>

=== Original mandate in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 ===

The [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]], Public Law 99-603, was the original impetus for the creation of the SAVE.<ref name=save-pia/><ref name=save-governing-laws/><ref name=epic>{{cite web|url = Spotlight on Surveillance, April 2007: SAVE System Can’t Save Itself From 11-Year History of Inaccuracy, Unreliability|publisher = [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]|date = April 1, 2007|accessdate = June 7, 2016}}</ref> The Act required the [[Immigration and Naturalization Services]] (INS) to establish a system for verifying the immigration status of non-citizen applicants applying for six federal benefit program (note that the jargon "federal public benefit" would be established much later, with the PRWORA):<ref name=epic/><ref name=save-governing-laws/>

* Some housing assistance programs ([[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]])

=== Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 ===

{{main article|Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996}}

The Personal Responsibility and Work Opprtunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (abbreviated PRWORA, also commonly described as the 1996 Welfare Reform Act)  made a number of changes to the laws surrounding eligibility for welfare benefits. The law defined "federal public benefits" and "state and local public benefits." PRWORA required the Attorney General to establish regulations and interim guidance for the verification of immigration status of persons applying for federal public benefits. The guidance is for any entity administering a non-exempt federal public benefit, other than non-profit charitable organizations, and is not limited to the agencies and programs specified in IRCA or those using SAVE. However, SAVE helps with compliance with this guidance.<ref name=save-governing-laws/>

=== Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ===

{{main article|Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996}}

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 required the [[Immigration and Naturalization Services]] (that would later be restructured as the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] and its sub-agency, [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]) to cooperate with federal, state, and local agencies to determine the citizenship or immigration status of any individual within the jurisdiction of the agency for any purposes authorized by law. The SAVE program is the way that DHS and USCIS meet the obligation.
