The Internet has given us unprecedented tools to track metrics about topics ranging from pop culture to politics to sports to technology. This page describes different methods of measuring how much a topic is being talked about online, along with ways to interpret these numbers for offline use.

Although the page different, mutually independent, methods, each of these methods is noisy and unreliable in different ways. Therefore, it is better to use multipe methods where applicable, and then combine the evidence gathered from those methods. This is based on the idea of combining many weak lines of evidence rather than relying on one strong line of evidence.<ref>[http://lesswrong.com/lw/hmb/many_weak_arguments_vs_one_relatively_strong/ Many Weak Arguments vs. One Relatively Strong Argument]</ref>

== Steps ==
=== Facebook page ===
#Identify a canonical (preferably official) Facebook page associated with the topic where applicable. For instance, for a singer or band, the singer or band will probably have an official Facebook page. Just start typing in the name in the Facebook search bar. You should see the official page appear as the top suggestion, and if it's official, you'll see a blue check mark at the end of the name.<ref name=facebook-verified-profile>[https://www.facebook.com/help/196050490547892 Verified Page or profile]</ref>[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 1.jpg|center]]
#Identify relevant metrics for the page, including:[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 2.jpg|center]]
#* Number of page likes. The current value, as well as the changes in the past two weeks, can be accessed by appending a "/likes" to the page URL, or equivalently, selecting the "Likes" option among the various options in the top panel to the right of the page photo. The "Likes" option may be hidden under "More" if the page has additional panel options.<ref>For instance, Taylor Swift's likes page is [https://www.facebook.com/TaylorSwift/likes https://www.facebook.com/TaylorSwift/likes]</ref>
#* Number of people "talking about this". This can be accessed on the same page as the number of page likes. <ref name=adweek-ptat>[http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/people-talking-about-this-defined/273447 ‘People Talking About This’ defined]</ref>
#* Number of likes for (and other reactions to) recent posts on the page.
#* Nature of comments and quality of the comments.
#* Number of page likes from your friends. This is particularly helpful if your friends are interested in the domain. This can give you a somewhat better idea of the profile of people who like the page (it can also address the problem of fake likes, discussed below). Look in the search results or below the profile picture to see how many overall people and how many of your friends liked it.
#* Some samples of users who like the page. You can either use your friends, or use other people who have liked recent posts on the page. Click through to their profiles to get a better understanding of who they are, where they are 
#Compare the metrics for the page with metrics for pages of competing entities, to put it in better context. For instance, to evaluate Katy Perry, it makes sense to compare with contemporaries such as Taylor Swift or Shakira, but a direct comparison with Barack Obama doesn't make sense. You can even get Facebook to show you pages similar to a given page, by typing "Pages similar to Katy Perry" in the search bar. [[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 3.jpg|center]]
#Be aware that, in some cases, the number of non-official pages (including fan pages) about the topic on Facebook can also give an idea of the topic's popularity. Also, pages about subsidiary topics can also give an idea. For instance, in the case of a singer, the existence and popularity of Facebook pages about the singer's songs can be a valuable indicator of the singer's popularity.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 4.jpg|center]]
#Adjust for fake likes and shallow likes.
#*The problem of fake likes arises when a lot of bots like a given page. This can happen either due to the page buying likes (either intentionally buying bot likes, or doing so unintentionally while under the impression of buying legitimate likes). It can also arise because bots, in order to appear like genuine users, may like pages of various celebrities or important topics or brands. Therefore, this problem needs to be controlled for most if you think the page may have tried to buy likes, ''or'' if the topic is a major celebrity or brand.<ref name=socialbakers-fake-facebook>[http://socialdraft.com/how-to-identify-fake-likes-and-followers/ How To Check If a Brand Has Fake Likes and Followers]</ref>
#*The problem of "shallow likes" is related to the problem of fake likes. Shallow likes refer to cases where the users are real, legitimate humans using the site properly, but they are not genuinely interested in the topic. They may have liked the topic as a result of being shown a sponsored post, or in error. Whether shallow likes is a problem for your estimat eof popularity depends on how you plan to use the estimate.
#*In many cases, fake likes and shallow likes may be hard to separate out. However, if the goal is to determine legitimate, engaged likes, then it's not necessary to separate fake and shallow likes.
#*Some strategies to detect and address shallow likes include: looking at the ratio of "people talking about this" to page likes, looking at the fraction of likes that are from your friends, looking at the quality of some sample likers, and examining engagement on individual posts (all of these were mentioned in Step 2). A further way of detecting fake likes is to look at the most popular week, city, and age group, and see if they make sense given the topic in question. In particular, if the most popular city is not one where the topic is known to be popular, and in particular if it is a low-income country such as Pakistan or Bangladesh that is unlikely to be the most popular, then the likes are likely to be fake.<ref>[http://www.pammarketingnut.com/2013/03/how-to-determine-if-a-facebook-business-page-has-fake-fans/ How to Determine if a Facebook Business Page has Fake Fans]</ref><ref name=socialbakers-fake-facebook/>


=== Wikipedia page ===
#Identify the canonical Wikipedia page for the topic in the language(s) of interest. For most topics that are reasonably popular, there will be an English Wikipedia page.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 5.jpg|center]]
#Get information on the number of pageviews of the canonical page. This could be done in many ways:[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 6.jpg|center]]
#* For pageviews up to December 2015, use the [http://stats.grok.se stats.grok.se] tool to get the page view counts for the page by month and by day within each month. This tool ''only'' includes desktop pageviews and does ''not'' exclude bots.<ref name=sgs-about>[http://stats.grok.se/about Wikipedia article traffic statistics (stats.grok.se) about page]</ref>
#* For pageviews from July 2015 onward, you can use the Wikipedia pageviews API (either directly, or by graphing it on Wikipedia, or through Wikipedia Views as discussed below). You can get pageview counts for desktop, mobile-app, and mobile-web. You can also filter the user to user, bot, or spider.<ref name=wikipedia-pageviews-api-about>[https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/?doc#!/Pageviews_data/get_metrics_pageviews_per_article_project_access_agent_article_granularity_start_end Wikimedia REST API]</ref>
#* To get combined data over all time, you can use Wikipedia Views (that uses stats.grok.se data till December 2015 and API data from January 2016 onward)<ref>[http://wikipediaviews.org/about/ Wikipedia Views: About]</ref> or Wikipedia Trends (that switched to using the API starting August 2015).<ref name=wikipediatrends-about>[http://www.wikipediatrends.com/FAQ.php Wikipedia Trends FAQ]</ref>
#Use other proxies for importance, including:[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 7.jpg|center]]
#* The number of pages that link to the page (click the "What links here" under Tools on the left sidebar of the Wikipedia page).
#* The length of the Wikipedia page.
#* The number of edits made to the page: Click the "View History" button on the top right to see the edit history.
#* The heat of debate in the corresponding Talk page.
#* The number of languages it's in (on the page in any language, you can see links in the left sidebar to versions in other languages).
#Compare with Wikipedia pages on topics in the same reference class. Do this for the steps above. For instance, Katy Perry might be compared to Shakira or Taylor Swift.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 8.jpg|center]]
# Correct for bots.
#* In particular, when looking at data using stats.grok.se (prior to data being available through the Wikipedia pageviews API) keep in mind that a lot of traffic could be coming from bots and spiders. For data before August 2015, the official estimate is that about 15% of traffic is from bots and spiders, and the proportion is greater for less trafficked pages. Unlike the case of social media, the goal of these bots is not to boost the status of pages being visited but simply to scrape information.
#* One way of determining the prevalence of bots is to look at pageviews API data and measure the number of pageviews by bots and spiders since this data became available, then extrapolate this to earlier times.

=== Google Search ===
#Use [http://www.google.com/trends Google Trends] to compare the search volume for the topic with the search volume for other topics. Because of its design, Google Trends only gives relative numbers and cannot give absolute search volume, so it is best used to compare different pages in the same reference class.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 9.jpg|center]]

=== Twitter page ===
#Search for the canonical (preferably official) Twitter page associated with the topic. As is the case with Facebook, canonical pages may not exist. Also, some celebrities maintain a personal as well as a media or company Twitter account, and it can be difficult deciding which one to use. Look for the account with the blue checkmark and with the larger number of followers. [[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 10.jpg|center]]
#Look at the number of followers, as well as the number of retweets and favorites of posts. Compare with competing topics. You can see the page's total number of followers at the top, and you can examine the number of retweets and favorites under any given tweet they've posted.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 11.jpg|center]]
#Make corrections for the large number of fake followers on Twitter. Twitter has a fairly large problem of fake accounts, more so than Facebook, partly because Twitter, by design, does not focus on real identity and does not require a user to have only one account.<ref name=nytimes-bits-twitter-fake-celebrities>[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/researchers-call-out-twitter-celebrities-with-suspicious-followings/ Researchers Call Out Twitter Celebrities With Suspicious Followings]</ref><ref>[http://www.forbes.com/sites/tristanlouis/2013/04/07/twitters-growing-spam-problem/#4acdbeb14a59 Twitter's Growing Spam Problem]</ref><ref>[http://www.forbes.com/sites/johngreathouse/2012/08/27/celebrities-with-the-most-allegedly-fake-twitter-followers/#3d4d3a65468a Celebrities With The Most (Allegedly) Fake Twitter Followers]</ref><ref>[http://www.forbes.com/sites/chereenzaki/2013/03/26/paying-for-followers-may-cost-you-a-job/#4d590ebc9942 Paying For Followers May Cost You A Job]</ref>
#* There are a few different online tools you can use to estimate the extent to which a Twitter account's followers are fake. The numbers are based on heuristics used by these websites and may not be accurate. One such tool, that allows you to enter any Twitter account, is Twitter Audit.<ref name=twitteraudit>[https://www.twitteraudit.com/ Twitter Audit]; examples are the [https://www.twitteraudit.com/HillaryClinton audit of Hillary Clinton] and the [https://www.twitteraudit.com/KatyPerry audit of Katy Perry]</ref><ref>[http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/blogs/550151/twitter-audit-check-how-many-fake-followers-you-have-on-instagram.html This Is How You Can Check Who's Buying Fake Followers On Twitter] (Marie Claire)</ref><ref>[http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-keep-your-twitter-following-authentic/ How to keep your Twitter following authentic. Fake followers hurt your credibility -- so clean up your follower list!] (CNET)</ref>

=== YouTube Channel ===
#Be aware that this method applies only for topics where video is a primary form of consumption. Musicians are good candidates for this method. Look for the official channel of the musician by searching for it within YouTube. If you can't find it easily, first look for the top result for one of the musician's more famous videos, then see the channel the video is under. A blue checkmark identifies the official channel (though not all YouTube channels have these checkmarks).[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 12.jpg|center]]
#Navigate to the videos tab inside the channel and sort videos by "Most Popular" to get a sense of how widely viewed the channel's videos are. You can also see the number of subscribers to the channel above the videos, in the subscribe button on the right.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 13.jpg|center]]
#Use SocialBlade and click Monthly Statistics. to track subscribers and video views over the past month. See [http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/szyzyg/monthly Scott Manley's monthly statistics] as an example.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 14.jpg|center]]

=== Website ===
#Identify whether the topic has a canonical website, and whether it makes sense to use website traffic as a proxy for the topic's popularity or importance. Tracking popularity of the website can be useful in cases where there is a canonical website that people go to in order to consume or engage with the topic. This is not the case for many topics.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 15.jpg|center]]
#*For instance, [http://www.shakira.com Shakira's website] gets negligible traffic compared to her online fame, because people consume her products on video websites or by purchasing her music. In contrast, for an information website such as WikiHow, the primary mode of consumption is via accessing the website.
#Consider the following options for tracking website traffic:[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 16.jpg|center]]
#* Alexa rank and traffic reported for the website: While not very reliable, this gives a rough  order of magnitude estimate. Alexa is more reliable for more highly trafficked sites.
#* The website's self-reported traffic and usage metrics.
#* Other tools such as QuantCast and HypeStat. These are not free except for the lists of top few websites.

=== Instagram page ===

#Search for the official Instagram page associated with the topic. As is the case with Facebook and Twitter, Instagram pages may not exist.
=== Fan pages and websites ===
#Use this method in the right cases. It is most useful for fiction book series and TV series. Examples include the Harry Potter series, A Song of Ice and Fire (and the associated TV series, Game of Thrones), Breaking Bad, Gilmore Girls, and Star Trek. To begin with, identify the most prominent existing fan websites, including wikis, forums, and personally maintained websites by fans.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 17.jpg|center]]
# Look for fan websites on Wikia. For instance, there is a [http://harrypotter.wikia.com Harry Potter Wiki], a [http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com Gilmore Girls Wiki], and a [http://gameofthrones.wikia.com Game of Thrones Wiki]. You might also be able to find wikis unaffiliated with Wikia but using the same MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia, Wikia, WikiHow, and many other sites, so you should be able to locate corresponding metrics on those sites (an example is [http://awoiaf.westeros.org A Wiki of Ice and Fire], a wiki related to the book series that inspired the Game of Thrones TV series). Evaluate the reach of these by looking at:[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 18.jpg|center]]
#* Number of pages on the wiki.
#* Number of active contributors to the wiki.
#* Number of edits to the wiki.
#* Number of pageviews of the wiki.

== Tips ==

* Keep in mind that different metrics have different meanings, and they may not align up. The celebrity with the most Facebook likes may not have the most YouTube views, or the most Twitter followers. Weigh all the metrics appropriately depending on your goals. For instance, if your goal is to determine what celebrity people are most curious to read about, Wikipedia page views are a better metric, whereas if your goal is to determine what celebrity people like to consume more of, YouTube views are a better metric.
* Differences in the metrics can reveal interesting qualitative information about celebrities. For instance, Shakira has more Facebook likes than Taylor Swift or Katy Perry, but her English Wikipedia page gets fewer views. This could be for many possible reasons. Here's a non-exhaustive list of possibilities: (a) much of Shakira's fan base is in non-English languages, (b) since Facebook likes are cumulative, and Shakira has been around longer, she may have accumulated more likes, (c) Taylor Swift and Katy Perry are more likely to be "in the news" for controversies, driving more views to their Wikipedia pages. These hypotheses can be tested by looking at relevant metrics (such as views on non-English Wikipedia pages and YouTube channel views).
