This page explores ways for the people managing a website to better use Google Analytics to understand the profile of users for the website.

== Steps ==

=== Understanding your goals ===

# Understand your purpose behind understanding your website audience. Some possible motivations are discussed below.
#* Identifying changes to make to your site's content (articles, videos, products), style, and user flow. While demographic and interest data are potentially useful, the most valuable information here is actual user behavior on the site. The guide you are reading right now is ''not'' focused on this goal.
#* Identifying external advertising or promoted content (not affiliated directly with your site) to show to users, to better monetize your site. Demographic and interest data help you identify things you can show to your users that are relevant to them, even if not directly connected with your site. For instance, if your site is visited by many college students, showing ads for cheap college textbooks or study notes sites might make sense, even if your site is a music site. Conversely, an academic site targeted at college students may be a great place to advertise non-academic products targeted at college students.
#* Identifying ways of marketing your site or product offsite, e.g., through social media, search engine optimization, search ads, display ads, or real-life advertising. Once again, demographic and interest data are helpful because they help you understand where to find potential new visitors, customers, or community members.
# Understand the dimensions along which you'd like to get user data. One key consideration in identifying dimensions is the typical dimensions used by analytics providers, advertisers. These may not exactly match your goals, but they may be the best you can get. The following dimensions are typically used when people think of user profiling; not all of these are offered by Google Analytics (GA), but they give an idea of the universe of possibilities:
#* Language (available)
#* Location (available)
#* Gender (available in GA if activated)
#* Age (available in GA if activated)
#* Interests (in-market segments and affinity categories) (available in GA if activated)
#* Highest education level completed or currently pursuing (not available in GA)
#* Current occupation (not available in GA)
#* Income level (not available in GA)
#* Race/ethnicity (not available in GA)
# Understand the different ways that the information might be inferred:
#* Some information is implicitly collected from the environment in which the user interacts with the website. For instance, location can be inferred from the user's IP address, and language can be read from the user's browser setting.
#* Some information is inferred from the user's entire web activity, tracked using ad tracking cookies. Interests are typically inferred this way; other data may also be inferred this way when not present in a more reliable form.
#* Some information is explicitly entered by the user, such as information that users enter into their Facebook or Google profiles. While generally the most reliable, this does depend on trusting the user to enter the data accurately (in most cases, this information is not verified by third parties).
# Keep in mind that many of these demographic variables are valuable for providing insight, rather than absolute statements. For instance, it's not the case that all women behave in one way and all men behave in another way. However, the fact that a website is visited mostly by women gives some insight into the type of audience it attracts. In fact, it even provides insight into the male audience it attracts. More explicitly, if the majority of a site's visitors are female, it's likely that even the male visitors have interests that are more stereotypically female.

=== Being aware of statistical and ethical framework and pitfalls ===

# Understand the difference between index and composition.
#* For any dimension (such as age, gender, ethnicity, income bucket) we can consider the ''composition'' of your website visitors based on that dimension. For the simplest example, gender, the composition of your website visitors by gender will read something like "45% male, 55% female." Composition data is available in Google Analytics for any dimension that is being tracked.
#* Another idea related to composition is that of the ''index'' (as Quantcast cals it).<ref name=quantcast-index>[https://www.quantcast.com/help/guides/reading-our-reports/ Reading Our Reports]</ref> The index becomes relevant when the overall sizes of the populations for various values of the dimension are different. For instance, in the United States, whites (Caucasians) constitute about 70% of the population, whereas blacks (African-Americans) constitute about 15% of the population. A website 

=== Exploring user data using Google Analytics ===

# The following pieces of user data are available even without any special efforts to track demographic data. This data is directly collected by Google Analytics through its tracking beacon and does not require joining with external data about the user.
#* Language: This is read from the setting in the user's browser as the user's language of first preference. It may not be the language that the user actually speaks or considers his/her first language. Partly, it is unreliable because many users don't touch the default preferred language that comes with the browser when they install it.<ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2013/02/12/languages-report-google-analytics/ Languages Report in Google Analytics]</ref> Languages are specified using two- or four-letter codes.<ref>[http://searchenginewatch.com/sew/how-to/2269346/google-analytics-language-report-what-you-can-learn-about-your-visitors Google Analytics Language Report: What You Can Learn About Your Visitors]</ref><ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2010/11/15/google-analytics-language-codes/ Some Google Analytics Language Codes]</ref>
#* Location (country and city): This is inferred from the user's IP address. Google Analytics does not display actual IP addresses for privacy reasons. While generally reliable, this may not be accurate for users using a VPN, since the geographical location of the VPN may differ from the user's actual geographical location. Location data may be missing or unreliable for people using mobile browsers, and in particular for people using Opera Mini which routes all traffic through central servers.<ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2013/03/19/locations-report-google-analytics/ The Locations Report in Google Analytics]</ref>
#* Operating system and browser: This is inferred from the user agent string used by the browser. This is generally accurate, except in cases where the user is running an emulator or virtual machine that emulates a different browser or operating system.<ref>[https://www.petroglyphcreative.com/blog/2014/browser-os-from-analytics Who's looking at you? Browser/OS from Google Analytics]</ref>
#* Network: This is inferred from the user's IP address.<ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2008/12/15/network-location-google-analytics/ Using Network Location in Google Analytics]</ref>
# Demographic and interest data are collected only if you as a website owner opt in. You need to first upgrade Google Analytics to enable remarketing and advertising features,<ref>[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2444872 Enable Remarketing and Advertising Reporting Features in Google Analytics]</ref> then turn on demographics and interest reports.<ref>[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2819948?hl=en Enable Demographics and Interests reports]</ref>
#* Google Analytics joins user data with the following three data sources to identify users: the third-party DoubleClick cookie (DoubleClick, also known as the Google Ad Exchange, is a display advertising network owned by Google), the Android Advertising ID (for apps on Android devices), and the iOS Identifier for Advertisers (for apps on iOS devices). Of these three, the only one relevant to web activity is the DoubleClick cookie.<ref name=data-collection/>
#* You can view demographic data by going to Audience > Demographics in the Reporting tab of Google Analytics. If Google Analytics tells you that the data isn't available, follow the instructions to enable it.
#* You can view interest data by going to Audience > Interests. If Google Analytics tells you that the data isn't available, follow the instructions to enable it.
#* Make sure that your website's privacy policy (if any) reflects these changes. This is particularly important if your audience is privacy-conscious, if you are required by law to disclose the information, or if your previous privacy policy explicitly stated that third-party cooking tracking would not occur.<ref>[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2700409?hl=en Policy requirements for Google Analytics Advertising Features]</ref>
# Understand precisely what the demographic and interest data on Google Analytics mean:
#* Demographic and interest data is available only for users for whom Google Analytics can join the user's Google Analytics cookie with a DoubleClick ad-tracking cookie for which the relevant information is available. The percentage can vary from 25% to 100%.
#* Demographic and interest data is not available for users who have adblockers turned on, which includes a lot of technologically sophisticated and privacy-conscious users. If this is an important segment of your audience, then the results you see could be biased. Other reasons demographic and interest data may be unavailable include: the user is on a different browser than his or her typical one, the user is using incognito or private browsing, the user has disabled or cleared cookies, or the user has disabled Javascript.
#* Demographic and interest data will be inaccurate for people who share computers. This may be relevant for spouses, siblings, children, or parents who occasionally use the primary user's device for browsing.
#* In order to protect the privacy of minors, demographic and interest data is not available for people under the age of 18.
#* As a user, you might be interested in looking at what information Google Analytics has collected about you. This might help you (anecdotally) get a feel for the accuracy of the data. If you are logged in to your Google account, you can access the information about yourself online.<ref>[https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated?hl=en Control your Google ads]</ref>
# Consider segmentation using two or more dimensions.
#* You can segment using up to two dimensions in the default view, without creating a custom report. To do this, simply go to the appropriate place for the first dimension (for instance, go to Audience > Interests > Gender) to select gender as the primary dimension. Then, select the appropriate secondary dimension by clicking on the place where that may be entered and typing in the dimension (the drop-down will help you narrow your choice).
#* If you want to drill down on more than two dimensions, you will need to do so by creating a custom report. However, note that due to size limitations, the custom report may end up not displaying the data you want.
# Note that size limitations (in both directions) and how these may skew your results.
#* If the total amount of data is too large, Google Analytics may use subsampling. Subsampling means that Google Analytics will not look at all the data points but rather look at a subset and extrapolate from what it observes on that subset. Choosing a smaller date range might solve this problem. Note that this problem applies only if you have over 250,000 sessions over the date range you are considering.
#* If a particular form of segmentation results in too little data in one or more of the segments, then Google Analytics may choose not to display the information, in order to protect the privacy of individual users. Google Analytics calls this "thresholding". Choosing a larger date range might solve this problem. Also, reducing the number of dimensions along which you are drilling down can also help.<ref name=data-collection>[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2954071 Demographics and Interests data collection and thresholds]</ref>

=== Understanding the gender and age data ===

# Compare your website's gender and age data against benchmarks and against common sense.
#* Google Analytics does not provide benchmarks for gender and age by website category. However, other servies, like Quantcast, have gender and age data for some selected sites that use Quantcast and have opted in to making their data publicly available. Note that Quantcast data tends to be quite unreliable for sites that do not use its Quantified Measure tool, but is reasonably reliable for sites that use the Quantified Measure tool (i.e., they allow Quantcast to track all user activity on the site). Moreover, it is in general agreement with Google Analytics on the user distribution by gender and age.
#* In order to get a clearer sense for the reliability of Quantcast's numbers for your website, you may want to turn on Quantified Measure for your own site so that you can compare those numbers with Google Analytics and verify that they agree where both numbers are available. Note that Quantified Measure also offers demographic information about users, so it might be interesting anyway to sign up for it.
# Below are some approximate benchmarks, based on a mix of data from Quantcast and Google Analytics data that some publishers have chosen to share.
#* Few sites will have more than 95% of their audience of one gender. Partly, this is because even if all their audience were of one gender, Google Analytics would likely misidentify some audience members. Partly, this is because any topics that interests a large number of human beings is likely to interest at least a few human beings of each gender.
#* Perhaps the most extreme gender ratios are seen on websites in the Stack Exchange network for technology communities, with the proportion of males ranging from 90% to 97%. This is because these websites combine two attributes favoring males: they are about technology and programming topics, where males are overrepresented, and they use the Q&A format, which seems to elicit more participation from males.<ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/stackoverflow.com Quantcast report for Stack Overflow, the flagship site of the Stack Exchange network]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/serverfault.com Quantcast report for Server Fault, a site on the Stack Exchange network]</ref>
#* Sports news and hardcore gaming websites are most heavily male-skewed, with the proportion of users that is male usually higher than 80% and possibly even higher than 90%.<ref name=quantcast-rantsports>[https://www.quantcast.com/rantsports.com Quantcast report for Rant Sports]</ref><ref name=quantcast-mmorpg>[https://www.quantcast.com/mmorpg.com Quantcast report for MMORPG]</ref>
#* Pornography websites tend to be male-skewed, but not as heavily as you might naively think. For instance, leading pornography website Pornhub estimates that 24% of their visitors in 2015 were female, and also expects that the percentage of females viewing porn will increase over time.<ref name=pornhub-2015-in-review>[http://www.pornhub.com/insights/pornhub-2015-year-in-review Pornhub’s 2015 Year in Review]</ref>
#* Real-time politics news websites tend to get around 75% to 85% of their traffic from males. This may be attributed partly to the sports-like nature of politics news, and partly to the fact that males are overrepresented in sectors such as politics and government lobbying where people need to keep track of real-time news.<ref name=quantcast-thehill>[https://www.quantcast.com/thehill.com Quantcast report for The Hill, a political news site focused on the United States federal government]</ref><ref name=quantcast-politico>[https://www.quantcast.com/politico.com Quantcast report for Politico,  a political news site focused on the United States federal government]</ref><ref>[https://www.quora.com/Why-does-it-seem-like-women-are-less-interested-in-politics-than-men Why does it seem like women are less interested in politics than men?]</ref>
#* Websites covering political and policy news tend to be male-skewed, though generally less so than the heavily real-time-focused ones. The percentage of males varies between 65% and 85%. The male skew tends to increase with the heterodox nature of the political and policy positions espoused by the website. For instance, policy-focused news and analysis website Vox is 70% male,<ref name=quantcast-vox>[https://www.quantcast.com/vox.com Quantcast report for Vox]</ref> whereas ''Reason'', a libertarian magazine, is 84% male.<ref name=quantcast-reason>[https://www.quantcast.com/reason.com Quantcast report for Reason, a libertarian magazine website]</ref> Conservative news sites also tend to be more heavily male, partly driven by the bias towards older people and the fact that among older age groups, Internet use is more heavily male.<ref name=quantcast-dc>[https://www.quantcast.com/dailycaller.com Quantcast report for The Daily Caller]</ref>
#* Science and technology news websites tend to be moderately male-skewed, with the percentage of audience that is male being between 65% and 85%. Both the science/technology aspect and the news aspect tend to bias in favor of males, though neither bias is very strong.<ref name=quantcast-venturebeat>[https://www.quantcast.com/venturebeat.com Quantcast report for VentureBeat] (VentureBeat is a technology website that focuses on reporting venture deals)</ref><ref name=quantcast-phys>[https://quantcast.com/phys.org Quantcast report on phys.org, a science news website]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/technologyreview.com Quantcast report for Technology Review]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/sciencealert.com Quantcast report for Science Alert]</ref>
#* Mainstream news websites such as CNN and MSNBC are between 60% and 70% male.<ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/msnbc.com Quantcast report for MSNBC]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/cnn.com Quantcast report for CNN]</ref> However, see the next bullet point.
#* Celebrity news, entertainment news, and light-hearted entertainment websites tend to be moderately female-skewed, with the percentage of audience that is female being between 50% and 80%. An example is NBC.com, that is about 60% female.<ref name=quantcast-nbc>[https://www.quantcast.com/nbc.com Quantcast report for NBC]</ref> Another example is Soompi, an English-language website focusing on the happenings in South Korean drama, that trends 80% female.<ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/soompi.com Quantcast report on Soompi]</ref> However, a celebrity news site that focuses more on pictures of scantily clad women, or semi-pornographic material, and less on gossip will tend to be more male-skewed. For instance, a website such as The Chive or Uproxx will be male-skewed,<ref name=quantcast-thechive>[https://www.quantcast.com/thechive.com Quantcast report for The Chive]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/uproxx.com Quantcast report for Uproxx]</ref> whereas a more BuzzFeed-like website (such as Upworthy or LifeBuzz) will be female-skewed.<ref name=quantcast-lifebuzz>[https://www.quantcast.com/lifebuzz.com Quantcast report for LifeBuzz]</ref><ref name=quantcast-upworthy>[https://www.quantcast.com/upworthy.com Quantcast report for Upworthy]</ref>
#* Food consumption websites (not focused on recipes or cooking) can range anywhere from even (50% for each gender) to moderately female skewed (70% female) depending on the type of content.<ref name=quantcast-eater>[https://www.quantcast.com/eater.com Quantcast report for Eater.com]</ref><ref name=quantcast-yelp>[https://www.quantcast.com/yelp.com Quantcast report for Yelp]</ref>
#* Cooking and home furnishing sites are likely to be heavily female-skewed, usually somewhere between 70% and 90% female. The style of the site is an important determinant in how extreme the female skew is.<ref name=quantcast-apartment-therapy>[https://www.quantcast.com/apartmenttherapy.com Quantcast report for Apartment Therapy, a home improvement website]</ref><ref name=quantcast-thekitchn>[https://www.quantcast.com/thekitchn.com Quantcast report for The Kitchn, a recipe website]</ref><ref name=quantcast-ohsheglows>[https://www.quantcast.com/ohsheglows.com Quantcast report for Oh She Glows, a vegan recipe website]</ref>
#* Fashion, style, and beauty sites are likely to be very female-skewed, with the proportion varying between 70% and 90%.<ref name=quantcast-refinery29>[https://www.quantcast.com/refinery29.com Quantcast report for Refinery 29, a fashion website]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/thezoereport.com Quantcast report for The Zoe Report, a female-focused fashion and style website]</ref>
#* A good rule of thumb is to look on Quantcast for other websites covering similar topics as yours. It is useful that all the Stack Exchange websites have demographic data available on Quantcast, so those can be used as a benchmark. However, Q&A websites have somewhat of a male bias relative to other websites on the same topics, so you will need to adjust based on that.
# Keep in mind the relative size of the male and female population in your target location and age group.
#* In the United States, the number of male and female Internet users is approximately equal, so for the US as a whole, no adjustment needs to be made. However, in some other countries, such as India, Internet users tend to be disproportionately male (the skew could be partly misleading because of the use of shared computers between family members, that are registered in the name of a male member).<ref>[http://www.statista.com/statistics/272438/gender-distribution-of-internet-users-in-india/ Distribution of internet users in India as of October 2015, by gender]</ref> In this case, rather than just looking at the percentage of users by gender, it is more helpful to look at this percentage adjusted for the overall percentage of Internet users. Quantcast's reports do so and call it an "index"<ref name=quantcast-index/> but Google Analytics does not report this number directly.
#* Different age groups might have different gender distributions of Internet users. In particular, younger age groups are likely to have a closer-to-equal gender ratio, whereas older age groups are more likely to skew male. However, this can vary by location so it's best to look up the data in your target audience.
# Understand the potential for bias arising from your own marketing strategy. 
#* The gender bias could partly be a consequence of your own marketing strategy promoting the content to a particular gender. For instance, let's say you promote it (on Facebook, or by advertising on other websites) to audiences that have been identified as female. Or, you promote it in a forum where the audience is disproportionately female. In that case, you'll find that your website's visitors tend to be female, but this could just be an artifact of your promotion strategy. This creates a self-reinforcing feedback loop, which can lead you to forgo discovering new potential audiences.
#* One way around this is to filter using two dimensions in Google Analytics. For instance, you can filter by gender ''and'' the default channel grouping for referral. This gives you an idea of the proportion of your traffic from each combination of gender and default channel grouping. Take a look at the default channel grouping that is least influenced by your marketing strategy. For instance, if you have put in no direct efforts into search engine optimization targeted at a particular gender, then the proportion for organic search traffic is a better indicator. If you have no site presence on social media, then the proportion on social media is a better indicator.
#* Another way to counter the bias arising from promotion strategies and discovery is to look at users with a large number of pageviews. You can do this by selecting the primary dimension as gender and the secondary dimension as Page Depth. Now, you can see, for each depth, what the relative proportion of male and female users are. If your audience is majority female primarily because of your marketing strategy, but the website itself is not a good fit for females, you should see the relative proportion of male users increase with page depth.
