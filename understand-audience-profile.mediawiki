This page explores ways for the people managing a website to better use Google Analytics to understand the profile of users for the website.

== Steps ==

=== Understand your goals ===

# Understand your purpose behind understanding your website audience. Some possible motivations are discussed below.
#* Identify changes to make to your site's content (articles, videos, products), style, and user flow. While demographic and interest data are potentially useful, the most valuable information here is actual user behavior on the site (not the focus of this page).
#* Identify external advertising or promoted content (not affiliated directly with your site) to show to users, to better monetize your site. Demographic and interest data help you identify things you can show to your users that are relevant to them, even if not directly connected with your site. For instance, if your site is visited by many college students, showing ads for cheap college textbooks or study notes sites might make sense, even if your site is a music site. Conversely, an academic site targeted at college students may be a great place to advertise non-academic products targeted at college students.
#* Identify ways of marketing your site or product offsite, e.g., through social media, search engine optimization, search ads, display ads, or real-life advertising. Once again, demographic and interest data are helpful because they help you understand where to find potential new visitors, customers, or community members.
# Understand the dimensions along which you'd like to get user data. One key consideration in identifying dimensions is the typical dimensions used by analytics providers, advertisers. These may not exactly match your goals, but they may be the best you can get. The following dimensions are typically used when people think of user profiling; not all of these are offered by Google Analytics, but they give an idea of the universe of possibilities:
#* Gender
#* Age
#* Language
#* Location
#* Highest education level completed or currently pursuing
#* Current occupation
#* Income level
#* Race/ethnicity
#* Interests (in-market segments and affinity categories)
# Understand the different ways that the information might be inferred:
#* Some information is implicitly collected from the environment in which the user interacts with the website. For instance, location can be inferred from the user's IP address, and language can be read from the user's browser setting.
#* Some information is inferred from the user's entire web activity, tracked using ad tracking cookies. Interests are typically inferred this way; other data may also be inferred this way when not present in a more reliable form.
#* Some information is explicitly entered by the user, such as information that users enter into their Facebook or Google profiles. While generally the most reliable, this does depend on trusting the user to enter the data accurately (in most cases, this information is not verified by third parties).
# Keep in mind that many of these demographic variables are valuable for providing insight, rather than absolute statements. For instance, it's not the case that all women behave in one way and all men behave in another way. However, the fact that a website is visited mostly by women gives some insight into the type of audience it attracts. In fact, it even provides insight into the male audience it attracts. More explicitly, if the majority of a site's visitors are female, it's likely that even the male visitors have interests that are more stereotypically female.

=== Explore user data using Google Analytics ===

# The following pieces of user data are available even without any special efforts to track demographic data. This data is directly collected by Google Analytics through its tracking beacon and does not require joining with external data about the user.
#* Language: This is read from the setting in the user's browser as the user's language of first preference. It may not be the language that the user actually speaks or considers his/her first language. Partly, it is unreliable because many users don't touch the default preferred language that comes with the browser when they install it.<ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2013/02/12/languages-report-google-analytics/ Languages Report in Google Analytics]</ref> Languages are specified using two- or four-letter codes.<ref>[http://searchenginewatch.com/sew/how-to/2269346/google-analytics-language-report-what-you-can-learn-about-your-visitors Google Analytics Language Report: What You Can Learn About Your Visitors]</ref><ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2010/11/15/google-analytics-language-codes/ Some Google Analytics Language Codes]</ref>
#* Location (country and city): This is inferred from the user's IP address. Google Analytics does not display actual IP addresses for privacy reasons. While generally reliable, this may not be accurate for users using a VPN, since the geographical location of the VPN may differ from the user's actual geographical location. Location data may be missing or unreliable for people using mobile browsers, and in particular for people using Opera Mini which routes all traffic through central servers.<ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2013/03/19/locations-report-google-analytics/ The Locations Report in Google Analytics]</ref>
#* Operating system and browser: This is inferred from the user agent string used by the browser. This is generally accurate, except in cases where the user is running an emulator or virtual machine that emulates a different browser or operating system.<ref>[https://www.petroglyphcreative.com/blog/2014/browser-os-from-analytics Who's looking at you?

#* Network: This is inferred from the user's IP address.<ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2008/12/15/network-location-google-analytics/ Using Network Location in Google Analytics]</ref>
# Demographic and interest data are collected only if you as a website owner opt in. You need to first upgrade Google Analytics to enable remarketing and advertising features,<ref>[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2444872 Enable Remarketing and Advertising Reporting Features in Google Analytics]</ref> then turn on demographics and interest reports.<ref>[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2819948?hl=en Enable Demographics and Interests reports]</ref>
#* Google Analytics joins user data with the following three data sources to identify users: the third-party DoubleClick cookie (DoubleClick, also known as the Google Ad Exchange, is a display advertising network owned by Google), the Android Advertising ID (for apps on Android devices), and the iOS Identifier for Advertisers (for apps on iOS devices). Of these three, the only one relevant to web activity is the DoubleClick cookie.<ref name=data-collection/>
#* You can view demographic data by going to Audience > Demographics in the Reporting tab of Google Analytics. If Google Analytics tells you that the data isn't available, follow the instructions to enable it.
#* You can view interest data by going to Audience > Interests. If Google Analytics tells you that the data isn't available, follow the instructions to enable it.<
#* Make sure that your website's privacy policy (if any) reflects these changes. This is particularly important if your audience is privacy-conscious, if you are required by law to disclose the information, or if your previous privacy policy explicitly stated that third-party cooking tracking would not occur.<ref>[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2700409?hl=en Policy requirements for Google Analytics Advertising Features]</ref>
# Understand precisely what the demographic and interest data on Google Analytics mean:
#* Demographic and interest data is available only for users for whom Google Analytics can join the user's Google Analytics cookie with a DoubleClick ad-tracking cookie for which the relevant information is available. The percentage can vary from 25% to 100%.
#* Demographic and interest data is not available for users who have blocked ad-tracking cookies, which includes a lot of technologically sophisticated and privacy-conscious users. If this is an important segment of your audience, then the results you see could be biased.
#* In order to protect the privacy of minors, demographic and interest data is not available for people under the age of 18.
#* As a user, you might be interested in looking at what information Google Analytics has collected about you. You can do this by visiting the Google page on your preferences, age. and gender. This might help you (anecdotally) get a feel for the accuracy of the data. If you are logged in to your Google account, you can access the information about yourself online.<ref>[https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated?hl=en Control your Google ads]</ref>
# Consider segmentation using two or more dimensions.
#* You can segment using up to two dimensions in the default view, without creating a custom report. To do this, simply go to the appropriate place for the first dimension (for instance, go to Audience > Interests > Gender) to select gender as the primary dimension. Then, select the appropriate secondary dimension by clicking on the place where that may be entered and typing in the dimension (the drop-down will help you narrow your choice).
#* If you want to drill down on more than two dimensions, you will need to do so by creating a custom report. However, note that due to size limitations, the custom report may end up not displaying the data you want.
# Note size limitations and how these may skew your results.
#* If the total amount of data is too large, Google Analytics may use subsampling. Subsampling means that Google Analytics will not look at all the data points but rather look at a subset and extrapolate from what it observes on that subset. Choosing a smaller date range might solve this problem. Note that this problem applies only if you have over 250,000 sessions over the date range you are considering.
#* If a particular form of segmentation results in too little data in one or more of the segments, then Google Analytics may choose not to display the information, in order to protect the privacy of individual users. Google Analytics calls this "thresholding". Choosing a larger date range might solve this problem. Also, reducing the number of dimensions along which you are drilling down can also help.<ref name=data-collection>[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2954071 Demographics and Interests data collection and thresholds]</ref>

=== Understand the gender and age data ===

# Compare your website's gender and age data against benchmarks and against common sense.
#* Google Analytics does not provide benchmarks for gender and age by website category. However, other servies, like Quantcast, have gender and age data for some selected sites that use Quantcast and have opted in to making their data publicly available. Note that Quantcast data tends to be quite unreliable for sites that do not use its Quantified Measure tool, but is reasonably reliable for sites that use the Quantified Measure tool (i.e., they allow Quantcast to track all user activity on the site). Moreover, it is in general agreement with Google Analytics on the user distribution by gender and age.
#* In order to get a clearer sense for the reliability of Quantcast's numbers for your website, you may want to turn on Quantified Measure for your own site so that you can compare those numbers with Google Analytics and verify that they agree where both numbers are available. Note that Quantified Measure also offers demographic information about users, so it might be interesting anyway to sign up for it.
# Below are some approximate benchmarks, based on a mix of data from Quantcast and Google Analytics data that some publishers have chosen to share.
#* Few sites will have more than 95% of their audience of one gender. Partly, this is because even if all their audience were of one gender, Google Analytics would likely misidentify some audience members. Partly, this is because any topics that interests a large number of human beings is likely to interest at least a few human beings of each gender.
#* Sports news websites are more heavily male-skewed, with the proportion of users that is male possibly higher than 90%.
#* Pornography, science and technology, gaming, and policy-oriented websites tend to be moderately male-skewed, with the percentage of audience that is male being between 50% and 80%.
#* Celebrity news, entertainment news, and light-hearted entertainment websites tend to be moderately female-skewed, with the percentage of audience that is female being between 50% and 80%. However, a celebrity news site that focuses more on pictures of scantily clad women, or semi-pornographic material, and less on gossip will tend to be more male-skewed. For instance, a website such as The Chive will be male-skewed, whereas a website such as BuzzFeed will be female-skewed.
#* Cooking and home furnishing sites are likely to be heavily female-skewed. The style of the site is an important determinant in how extreme the female skew is.
#* Fashion, style, and beauty sites are likely to be very female-skewed, at 90% or higher.
