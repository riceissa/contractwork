This page explores ways for the people managing a website to better use analytics tools to better understand the profile of website visitors.

This page focuses more on how to interpret, benchmark, and act upon the data. The procedural aspects (i.e., how to view the data in analytics providers) are not the focus of the page. However, we include information on the availability of the data in analytics tools such as Google Analytics (GA) and Quantcast Measure (QM).

The page is also focused on understanding users "in real life" (using conventional segments such as age, gender, location, and income level) rather than their on-site behavior.

== Steps ==

=== Understanding your setup ===

# The why: Understand your purpose behind understanding your website audience. Some possible motivations are discussed below.
#* Identifying changes to make to your site's content (articles, videos, products), style, and user flow. While demographic and interest data are potentially useful, the most valuable information here is actual user behavior on the site. The guide you are reading right now is ''not'' focused on this goal.
#* Identifying external advertising or promoted content (not affiliated directly with your site) to show to users, to better monetize your site. Demographic and interest data help you identify things you can show to your users that are relevant to them, even if not directly connected with your site. For instance, if your site is visited by many college students, showing ads for cheap college textbooks or study notes sites might make sense, even if your site is a music site. Conversely, an academic site targeted at college students may be a great place to advertise non-academic products targeted at college students.
#* Identifying ways of marketing your site or product offsite, e.g., through social media, search engine optimization, search ads, display ads, or real-life advertising. Once again, demographic and interest data are helpful because they help you understand where to find potential new visitors, customers, or community members.
# The how: Understand the different ways that the information might be inferred and how this affects the reliability of the data.
#* Note that all analytics services in widespread use work by sending data through Javascript to third-party websites, and use cookies (first-party for tracking a user within a site, and third-party for tracking users across sites) to identify users. In particular, ''no data'' is collected for users who have either disabled Javascript ''or'' have an adblocker on that blocks analytics tools. uBlock is an adblocker that defaults analytics tools as listed in the EasyPrivacy list, including GA.<ref name=easyprivacy>[https://easylist.github.io/easylist/easyprivacy.txt AdBlock Plus EasyPrivacy list]</ref><ref>[https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/465 EasyPrivacy enabled by default]</ref> Moreover, if the user has disabled cookies, or is using incognito/private browsing or a different browser or device, the user may not be correctly identified and the user's activity may not be properly connected together.
#* Some information, such as language, location, network, operating system, and browser, is implicitly collected from the environment in which the user interacts with the website.
#* Some information is inferred from the user's entire web activity, tracked using third-party cookies. Interests are typically inferred this way; other data (including demographic data) may also be inferred this way when not present in a more reliable form. This information is missing or inaccurate on browsers (such as Safari) where third-party cookies are mostly disallowed,<ref>[http://clubrunner.helpserve.com/Knowledgebase/Article/View/710/277/enable-third-party-cookies-for-safari Enable Third Party Cookies for Safari]</ref> as well as for users using most adblockers.
#* Some information is explicitly entered by the user, such as information that users enter into their Facebook or Google profiles. While generally the most reliable, this does depend on trusting the user to enter the data accurately (in most cases, this information is not verified by third parties). Google offers a hybrid solution for ad customization: it infers interest data automatically from browsing behavior but also allows logged-in users to edit their interests manually.<ref name=google-ads-preferences>[https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated?hl=en Control your Google ads. You can control the ads that are delivered to you based on your Google Account, across devices, by editing these settings. These ads are more likely to be useful and relevant to you.]</ref>
# The what: Understand the dimensions along which you'd like to get user data. One key consideration in identifying dimensions is the typical dimensions used by analytics providers and advertisers. These may not exactly match your goals, but they may be the best you can get. The following dimensions are typically used when people think of user profiling. Their availability in different analytics tools is indicated parenthetically.
#* Language (available in GA): GA reads language from the user's browser as the user's language of first preference. Data may not reflect the user's actual language of interest.<ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2013/02/12/languages-report-google-analytics/ Languages Report in Google Analytics]</ref> Languages are specified using two- or four-letter codes.<ref>[http://searchenginewatch.com/sew/how-to/2269346/google-analytics-language-report-what-you-can-learn-about-your-visitors Google Analytics Language Report: What You Can Learn About Your Visitors]</ref><ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2010/11/15/google-analytics-language-codes/ Some Google Analytics Language Codes]</ref>
#* Location (available in GA and QM down to the level of city): GA infers location from the user's IP address, but does not display actual IP addresses to protect privacy.<ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2013/03/19/locations-report-google-analytics/ The Locations Report in Google Analytics]</ref> Location data may be incorrect for users using a VPN or a mobile browser (such as Opera Mini) where page requests are handled server-side.
#* Network: This is inferred from the user's IP address.<ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2008/12/15/network-location-google-analytics/ Using Network Location in Google Analytics]</ref> This may be incorrect for users using a VPN or a mobile browser (such as Opera Mini) where page requests are handled server-side.
#* Operating system and browser: This is inferred from the user agent string used by the browser. This is generally accurate, except in cases where the user is running an emulator or virtual machine that emulates a different browser or operating system.<ref>[https://www.petroglyphcreative.com/blog/2014/browser-os-from-analytics Who's looking at you? Browser/OS from Google Analytics]</ref>
#* Gender and age (available in GA if activated; available in QM): This is collected only if you as a website owner opt in. You need to first upgrade Google Analytics to enable remarketing and advertising features,<ref name=ga-remarketing>[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2444872 Enable Remarketing and Advertising Reporting Features in Google Analytics]</ref> then turn on demographics and interest reports.<ref name=demographics-and-interest-reports>[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2819948?hl=en Enable Demographics and Interests reports]</ref> Google Analytics joins user data with the following three data sources to identify users: the third-party DoubleClick cookie (DoubleClick, also known as the Google Ad Exchange, is a display advertising network owned by Google), the Android Advertising ID (for apps on Android devices), and the iOS Identifier for Advertisers (for apps on iOS devices). Of these three, the only one relevant to web activity is the DoubleClick cookie.<ref name=data-collection/>
#* Interests (in-market segments and affinity categories) (available in GA if activated; available in QM): As with gender and age data, interest data is available only if you as a website opt in by first enabling remarketing and advertising features and them turning on demographics and interest reports.<ref name=ga-remarketing/><ref name=demographics-and-interest-reports/>
#* Highest education level completed or currently pursuing (not available in GA; available in QM)
#* Current occupation (not available in GA or QM)
#* Income level (not available in GA; available in QM)
#* Race/ethnicity (not available in GA; available in QM)

=== Being aware of statistical and ethical framework and pitfalls ===

# Understand the concepts of composition and index.
#* For any dimension (such as age, gender, ethnicity, income bucket) we can consider the ''composition'' of your website visitors based on that dimension. For the simplest example, gender, the composition of your website visitors by gender will read something like "45% male, 55% female." Composition data is available in GA and QM for any dimension that is being tracked.
#* Another idea related to composition is that of the ''index'' (as Quantcast calls it).<ref name=quantcast-index>[https://www.quantcast.com/help/guides/reading-our-reports/ Reading Our Reports]</ref> The index becomes relevant when the overall sizes of the populations for various values of the dimension are different. For instance, in the United States, African-Americans constitute 13% of the population. Thus, a website that gets 26% of its traffic from African-Americans is overrepresented among them (also known as "over-indexed"), even though they are still a minority of users. The index is essentially the ratio of the composition among website visitors to composition in the overall population, so in this case it is 200. An index above 100 means the subpopulation is over-indexed, whereas an index less than 100 means the subpopulation is under-indexed.
#* Unlike composition, that can be inferred purely based on the visitors to the website, the index requires the use of data for a general population. Moreover, the index can be different depending on what general population we use for benchmarking. For instance, for a local news website for a city, do we use the population of the city, or the population of the country, or world population? Do we restrict to people with Internet access, or to all people? 
#* Note that for large subpopulations, the index has a ceiling effect. For instance, non-Hispanic whites in the United States are 62% of the population, so even if a website gets 100% of its traffic from Caucasians, the index is still only 161. On the other hand, for a subpopulation that is only 5% of the whole population, the index could be as high as 2000.
#* The distinction between index and composition is less important when looking at gender, especially in developed countries, because the number of men and women using the Internet is almost equal.
# Keep in mind that composition and index are both ''relative'': neither measure how popular the site is on the whole with various subpopulations.
#* The composition is a measure of the ''relative'' proportion from different subpopulations. The index is a similar measure, but adjusting for overall population sizes.
#* For instance, a website can have a 95% male audience (so a male index of about 190), and yet be popular among a negligible minority of males. On the other hand, another website can have only a 30% male audience, and yet be visited by many more males, because it has way more ''overall'' traffic.
#* Put another way, changes to the composition may be in a direction opposite to changes in absolute numbers. For instance, if a website suddenly becomes popular in a forum visited mostly by females, the overall traffic from both males and females could go up, with the proportion of males going down.
# Keep in mind the feedback loop between how you promote your website and what audience it attracts. If you (intentionally or unintentionally) make your website more visible or prominent to some subpopulations, that will be reflected in the statistics. This could create a feedback loop: you advertise your website to a subpopulation, they use it more, and you focus your energies more on the subpopulation. There are three ways of identifying and countering this feedback loop.
#* Filter for traffic with referral sources or channels where you know you are not introducing any bias.
#* Use the population distribution in the channels that you are attracting traffic from as the baseline relative to which you index your site's visitors. For instance, if you are advertising your site on a forum where the audience is 70% female, and yet only 60% of the visitors from that forum are female, that might be an indication that your website appeals ''less'' to females, even though a majority of your site visitors are still female.
#* Restrict attention to visitors who are highly engaged (for instance, based on a threshold of number of pages viewed) or repeat visitors. Compare the composition of highly engaged or repeat visitors against the composition of all visitors.
# Keep in mind that the composition of your websites represents not just what you are doing on your site but also truths about people's preferences, society, and culture. You can change what you do on your site (in terms of content or advertising) but your influence on society and culture are likely to be small to begin with.
# For benchmarking, ompare your website against example websites that match it as closely as possible along the most relevant criteria. 
#* Since websites do not usually share their GA data, your best option for getting good benchmarks is Quantcast data. You can access Quantcast data for a website by typing in quantcast.com/domainname (you can exclude initial "www." from the domain name). Many websites do not use QM. Others use QM but make only some of the data visible to the public. You should scroll down to the section on demographic data to see if the website has allowed for sharing the information.
#* Quantcast data is available for most websites on the Stack Exchange Network. Therefore, looking for the closest site on the Stack Exchange network to your site can provide some insight. However, Stack Exchange sites are Q&A sites and traffic patterns to Q&A sites differ from those to other sites covering the same topics. The adjustments for different demographic dimensions are discussed at more length.
#* In order to better understand whether GA and QM data might diverge for sites like yours, you could turn on QM on your own site for a while and then compare that data against GA data for your own site. If the two are in agreement, then the numbers are likely to be reliable for other websites in your category.

=== Understanding the gender composition and index of your website ===

# Classify your website along a few broad criteria.
#* One of the most important determinants of expected gender composition of a website is the topic, or domain of the website. Domains range from female-heavy (such as cooking and fashion) to somewhat female-biased (celebrity news, pop culture, and feel-good stories) to somewhat male-biased (politics news and technology) to heavily male-biased (hardcore technology, gaming and sports).
#* A second determinant of gender composition is the format of presentation. This is a little tricky to understand because there are a number of mutualy cancelling factors at play. As a general rule, a website based around transactions (such as a question-and-answer website) would be male-biased, whereas a website centered around social interaction (in particular, sharing) would be female-biased, ''holding'' the underlying topic constant. Another general rule is around imagery: pictures of scantily clad women predict more male use, whereas all other kinds of pictures (including pictures of women that are intended to highlight their dresses or particular fashion choices, but also pictures of food) are more female-biased.
#* The reasons for these disparities by gender are difficult questions of social science. It is not, however, necessary for you to fully understand the reasons. The exception might be cases where you are explicitly trying to cater to a countercultural niche.
# Compare your website's gender and age data against benchmarks and against common sense. Quantcast data on gender for large websites is generally reliable and agrees with Google Analytics data where both are available, so you can use QM data for other websites to benchmark. The gender compositions of websites by category are described below.
#* Perhaps the most extreme gender ratios are seen on websites in the Stack Exchange network for technology communities, with the proportion of males ranging from 90% to 97%. This is because these websites combine two attributes favoring males: they are about technology and programming topics, where males are overrepresented, and they use the Q&A format, which seems to elicit more participation from males.<ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/stackoverflow.com Quantcast report for Stack Overflow, the flagship site of the Stack Exchange network]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/serverfault.com Quantcast report for Server Fault, a site on the Stack Exchange network]</ref>
#* Sports news and hardcore gaming websites tend to be heavily male-skewed, with the proportion of users that is male usually higher than 80% and possibly even higher than 90%.<ref name=quantcast-rantsports>[https://www.quantcast.com/rantsports.com Quantcast report for Rant Sports]</ref><ref name=quantcast-mmorpg>[https://www.quantcast.com/mmorpg.com Quantcast report for MMORPG]</ref>
#* Pornography websites tend to be male-skewed, but not as heavily as you might naively think. For instance, leading pornography website Pornhub estimates that 24% of their visitors in 2015 were female, and also expects that the percentage of females viewing porn will increase over time.<ref name=pornhub-2015-in-review>[http://www.pornhub.com/insights/pornhub-2015-year-in-review Pornhub’s 2015 Year in Review]</ref>
#* Real-time politics news websites tend to get around 75% to 85% of their traffic from males. This may be attributed partly to the sports-like nature of politics news, and partly to the fact that males are overrepresented in sectors such as politics and government lobbying where people need to keep track of real-time news.<ref name=quantcast-thehill>[https://www.quantcast.com/thehill.com Quantcast report for The Hill, a political news site focused on the United States federal government]</ref><ref name=quantcast-politico>[https://www.quantcast.com/politico.com Quantcast report for Politico,  a political news site focused on the United States federal government]</ref><ref>[https://www.quora.com/Why-does-it-seem-like-women-are-less-interested-in-politics-than-men Why does it seem like women are less interested in politics than men?]</ref>
#* Websites covering political and policy news tend to be male-skewed, though generally less so than the heavily real-time-focused ones. The percentage of males varies between 65% and 85%. The male skew tends to increase with the heterodox nature of the political and policy positions espoused by the website. For instance, policy-focused news and analysis website Vox is 70% male,<ref name=quantcast-vox>[https://www.quantcast.com/vox.com Quantcast report for Vox]</ref> whereas ''Reason'', a libertarian magazine, is 84% male.<ref name=quantcast-reason>[https://www.quantcast.com/reason.com Quantcast report for Reason, a libertarian magazine website]</ref> Conservative news sites also tend to be more heavily male, partly driven by the bias towards older people and the fact that among older age groups, Internet use is more heavily male.<ref name=quantcast-dc>[https://www.quantcast.com/dailycaller.com Quantcast report for The Daily Caller]</ref>
#* Science and technology news websites tend to be moderately male-skewed, with the percentage of audience that is male being between 65% and 85%. Both the science/technology aspect and the news aspect tend to bias in favor of males, though neither bias is very strong.<ref name=quantcast-venturebeat>[https://www.quantcast.com/venturebeat.com Quantcast report for VentureBeat] (VentureBeat is a technology website that focuses on reporting venture deals)</ref><ref name=quantcast-phys>[https://quantcast.com/phys.org Quantcast report on phys.org, a science news website]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/technologyreview.com Quantcast report for Technology Review]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/sciencealert.com Quantcast report for Science Alert]</ref>
#* Mainstream news websites such as CNN and MSNBC are between 60% and 70% male.<ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/msnbc.com Quantcast report for MSNBC]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/cnn.com Quantcast report for CNN]</ref> However, see the next bullet point.
#* Celebrity news, entertainment news, and light-hearted entertainment websites tend to be moderately female-skewed, with the percentage of audience that is female being between 50% and 80%. An example is NBC.com, that is about 60% female.<ref name=quantcast-nbc>[https://www.quantcast.com/nbc.com Quantcast report for NBC]</ref> Another example is Soompi, an English-language website focusing on the happenings in South Korean drama, that trends 80% female.<ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/soompi.com Quantcast report on Soompi]</ref> However, a celebrity news site that focuses more on pictures of scantily clad women, or semi-pornographic material, and less on gossip will tend to be more male-skewed. For instance, a website such as The Chive or Uproxx will be male-skewed,<ref name=quantcast-thechive>[https://www.quantcast.com/thechive.com Quantcast report for The Chive]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/uproxx.com Quantcast report for Uproxx]</ref> whereas a more BuzzFeed-like website (such as Upworthy or LifeBuzz) will be female-skewed.<ref name=quantcast-lifebuzz>[https://www.quantcast.com/lifebuzz.com Quantcast report for LifeBuzz]</ref><ref name=quantcast-upworthy>[https://www.quantcast.com/upworthy.com Quantcast report for Upworthy]</ref>
#* Food consumption websites (not focused on recipes or cooking) can range anywhere from even (50% for each gender) to moderately female skewed (70% female) depending on the type of content.<ref name=quantcast-eater>[https://www.quantcast.com/eater.com Quantcast report for Eater.com]</ref><ref name=quantcast-yelp>[https://www.quantcast.com/yelp.com Quantcast report for Yelp]</ref>
#* Cooking and home furnishing sites are likely to be heavily female-skewed, usually somewhere between 70% and 90% female. The style of the site is an important determinant in how extreme the female skew is.<ref name=quantcast-apartment-therapy>[https://www.quantcast.com/apartmenttherapy.com Quantcast report for Apartment Therapy, a home improvement website]</ref><ref name=quantcast-thekitchn>[https://www.quantcast.com/thekitchn.com Quantcast report for The Kitchn, a recipe website]</ref><ref name=quantcast-ohsheglows>[https://www.quantcast.com/ohsheglows.com Quantcast report for Oh She Glows, a vegan recipe website]</ref>
#* Fashion, style, and beauty sites are likely to be very female-skewed, with the proportion varying between 70% and 90%.<ref name=quantcast-refinery29>[https://www.quantcast.com/refinery29.com Quantcast report for Refinery 29, a fashion website]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/thezoereport.com Quantcast report for The Zoe Report, a female-focused fashion and style website]</ref>
# Keep in mind the relative size of the male and female population in your target location and age group.
#* In the United States, the number of male and female Internet users is approximately equal, so for the US as a whole, no adjustment needs to be made. However, in some other countries, such as India, Internet users tend to be disproportionately male (the skew could be partly misleading because of the use of shared computers between family members, that are registered in the name of a male member).<ref>[http://www.statista.com/statistics/272438/gender-distribution-of-internet-users-in-india/ Distribution of internet users in India as of October 2015, by gender]</ref> In this case, rather than just looking at the percentage of users by gender, it is more helpful to look at this percentage adjusted for the overall percentage of Internet users. Quantcast's reports do so and call it an "index"<ref name=quantcast-index/> but Google Analytics does not report this number directly.
#* Different age groups might have different gender distributions of Internet users. In particular, younger age groups are likely to have a closer-to-equal gender ratio, whereas older age groups are more likely to skew male. However, this can vary by location so it's best to look up the data in your target audience.
