This page explores ways for the people managing a website to better use analytics tools to better understand the profile of website visitors.

This page focuses more on how to interpret, benchmark, and act upon the data. The procedural aspects (i.e., how to view the data in analytics providers) is not the focus of the page. However, we include information on the availability of the data in analytics tools such as Google Analytics (GA) and Quantcast Measure (QM).

The page is also focused on understanding users "in real life" (using conventional segments such as age, gender, location, and income level) rather than their on-site behavior.

== Steps ==

=== Understanding your setup ===

# The why: Understand your purpose behind understanding your website audience. Some possible motivations are discussed below.
#* Identifying changes to make to your site's content (articles, videos, products), style, and user flow. While demographic and interest data are potentially useful, the most valuable information here is actual user behavior on the site. The guide you are reading right now is ''not'' focused on this goal.
#* Identifying external advertising or promoted content (not affiliated directly with your site) to show to users, to better monetize your site. Demographic and interest data help you identify things you can show to your users that are relevant to them, even if not directly connected with your site. For instance, if your site is visited by many college students, showing ads for cheap college textbooks or study notes sites might make sense, even if your site is a music site. Conversely, an academic site targeted at college students may be a great place to advertise non-academic products targeted at college students.
#* Identifying ways of marketing your site or product offsite, e.g., through social media, search engine optimization, search ads, display ads, or real-life advertising. Once again, demographic and interest data are helpful because they help you understand where to find potential new visitors, customers, or community members.
# The how: Understand the different ways that the information might be inferred and how this affects the reliability of the data.
#* Some information is implicitly collected from the environment in which the user interacts with the website. For instance, location can be inferred from the user's IP address, and language can be read from the user's browser setting.
#* Some information is inferred from the user's entire web activity, tracked using ad tracking cookies. Interests are typically inferred this way; other data may also be inferred this way when not present in a more reliable form.
#* Some information is explicitly entered by the user, such as information that users enter into their Facebook or Google profiles. While generally the most reliable, this does depend on trusting the user to enter the data accurately (in most cases, this information is not verified by third parties).
# The what: Understand the dimensions along which you'd like to get user data. One key consideration in identifying dimensions is the typical dimensions used by analytics providers and advertisers. These may not exactly match your goals, but they may be the best you can get. The following dimensions are typically used when people think of user profiling. Their availability in different analytics tools is indicated parenthetically.
#* Language (available in GA): GA reads language from the user's browser as the user's language of first preference. Data may not reflect the user's actual language of interest.<ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2013/02/12/languages-report-google-analytics/ Languages Report in Google Analytics]</ref> Languages are specified using two- or four-letter codes.<ref>[http://searchenginewatch.com/sew/how-to/2269346/google-analytics-language-report-what-you-can-learn-about-your-visitors Google Analytics Language Report: What You Can Learn About Your Visitors]</ref><ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2010/11/15/google-analytics-language-codes/ Some Google Analytics Language Codes]</ref>
#* Location (available in GA and QM down to the level of city): GA infers location from the user's IP address, but does not display actual IP addresses to protect privacy.<ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2013/03/19/locations-report-google-analytics/ The Locations Report in Google Analytics]</ref> Location data may be incorrect for users using a VPN or a mobile browser (such as Opera Mini) where page requests are handled server-side.
#* Network: This is inferred from the user's IP address.<ref>[http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2008/12/15/network-location-google-analytics/ Using Network Location in Google Analytics]</ref>
#* Operating system and browser: This is inferred from the user agent string used by the browser. This is generally accurate, except in cases where the user is running an emulator or virtual machine that emulates a different browser or operating system.<ref>[https://www.petroglyphcreative.com/blog/2014/browser-os-from-analytics Who's looking at you? Browser/OS from Google Analytics]</ref>
#* Gender and age (available in GA if activated; available in QM): This is collected only if you as a website owner opt in. You need to first upgrade Google Analytics to enable remarketing and advertising features,<ref name=ga-remarketing>[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2444872 Enable Remarketing and Advertising Reporting Features in Google Analytics]</ref> then turn on demographics and interest reports.<ref name=demographics-and-interest-reports>[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2819948?hl=en Enable Demographics and Interests reports]</ref> Google Analytics joins user data with the following three data sources to identify users: the third-party DoubleClick cookie (DoubleClick, also known as the Google Ad Exchange, is a display advertising network owned by Google), the Android Advertising ID (for apps on Android devices), and the iOS Identifier for Advertisers (for apps on iOS devices). Of these three, the only one relevant to web activity is the DoubleClick cookie.<ref name=data-collection/>
#* Interests (in-market segments and affinity categories) (available in GA if activated; available in QM): As with gender and age data, interest data is available only if you as a website opt in by first enabling remarketing and advertising features and them turning on demographics and interest reports.<ref name=ga-remarketing/><ref name=demographics-and-interest-reports/>
#* Highest education level completed or currently pursuing (not available in GA; available in QM)
#* Current occupation (not available in GA or QM)
#* Income level (not available in GA; available in QM)
#* Race/ethnicity (not available in GA; available in QM)

=== Being aware of statistical and ethical framework and pitfalls ===

# Understand the concepts of composition and index.
#* For any dimension (such as age, gender, ethnicity, income bucket) we can consider the ''composition'' of your website visitors based on that dimension. For the simplest example, gender, the composition of your website visitors by gender will read something like "45% male, 55% female." Composition data is available in Google Analytics (GA) for any dimension that is being tracked.
#* Another idea related to composition is that of the ''index'' (as Quantcast calls it).<ref name=quantcast-index>[https://www.quantcast.com/help/guides/reading-our-reports/ Reading Our Reports]</ref> The index becomes relevant when the overall sizes of the populations for various values of the dimension are different. For instance, in the United States, African-Americans constitute 13% of the population. Thus, a website that gets 26% of its traffic from African-Americans is overrepresented among them, even though they are still a minority of users. The index is essentially the ratio of the composition among website visitors to composition in the overall population, so in this case it is 200. An index above 100 means the subpopulation is overrepresented, whereas an index less than 100 means the subpopulation is underrepresented.
#* Unlike composition, that can be inferred purely based on the visitors to the website, the index requires the use of data for a general population. Moreover, the index can be different depending on what general population we use for benchmarking. For instance, for a local news website for a city, do we use the population of the city, or the population of the country, or world population? Do we restrict to people with Internet access, or to all people? 
#* Note that for large subpopulations, the index has a ceiling effect. For instance, non-Hispanic whites in the United States are 62% of the population, so even if a website gets 100% of its traffic from Caucasians, the index is still only 161. On the other hand, for a subpopulation that is only 5% of the whole population, the index could be as high as 2000.
#* The distinction between index and composition is less important when looking at gender, especially in developed countries, because the number of men and women using the Internet is almost equal.
# Keep in mind that composition and index are both ''relative'': neither measure how popular the site is on the whole with various subpopulations.
#* The composition is a measure of the ''relative'' proportion from different subpopulations. The index is a similar measure, but adjusting for overall population sizes.
#* A website can have a 95% male audience (so a male index of about 190), and yet be popular among a negligible minority of males. On the other hand, another website can have only a 30% male audience, and yet be visited by many more males, because it has way more ''overall'' traffic.
# Keep in mind the feedback loop between how you promote your website and what audience it attracts. If you (intentionally or unintentionally) make your website more visible or prominent to some subpopulations, that will be reflected in the statistics. This could create a feedback loop: you advertise your website to a subpopulation, they use it more, and you focus your energies more on the subpopulation. There are three ways of identifying and countering this feedback loop.
#* Filter for traffic with referral sources or channels where you know you are not introducing any bias.
#* Use the population distribution in the channels that you are attracting traffic from as the baseline relative to which you index your site's visitors. For instance, if you are advertising your site on a forum where the audience is 70% female, and yet only 60% of the visitors from that forum are female, that might be an indication that your website appeals ''less'' to females, even though a majority of your site visitors are still female.
#* Restrict attention to visitors who are highly engaged (for instance, based on a threshold of number of pages viewed) or repeat visitors. Compare the composition of highly engaged or repeat visitors against the composition of all visitors.
# Keep in mind that the composition of your websites represents a truth about people's preferences, society, and culture. Some of these preferences will change over time. However, the pace of change for these is quite slow, and not something your website alone can influence, until it becomes really big and influential.

=== Exploring user data using Google Analytics ===


=== Understanding the gender composition and index of your website ===

# Classify your website along a few broad criteria.
#* One of the most important determinants of expected gender composition of a website is the topic, or domain of the website. Domains range from female-heavy (such as cooking and fashion) to somewhat female-biased (celebrity news, pop culture, and feel-good stories) to somewhat male-biased (politics news and technology) to heavily male-biased (hardcore technology, gaming and sports).
#* A second determinant of gender composition is the format of presentation. This is a little tricky to understand because there are a number of mutualy cancelling factors at play. As a general rule, a website based around transactions (such as a question-and-answer website) would be male-biased, whereas a website centered around social interaction (in particular, sharing) would be female-biased, ''holding'' the underlying topic constant. Another general rule is around imagery: pictures of scantily clad women predict more male use, whereas all other kinds of pictures (including pictures of women that are intended to highlight their dresses or particular fashion choices, but also pictures of food) are more female-biased.
#* The reasons for these disparities by gender are difficult questions of social science. It is not, however, necessary for you to fully understand the reasons. The exception might be cases where you are explicitly trying to cater to a countercultural niche.


# Compare your website's gender and age data against benchmarks and against common sense.
#* Google Analytics does not provide benchmarks for gender and age by website category. However, other servies, like Quantcast, have gender and age data for some selected sites that use Quantcast and have opted in to making their data publicly available. Note that Quantcast data tends to be quite unreliable for sites that do not use its Quantified Measure tool, but is reasonably reliable for sites that use the Quantified Measure tool (i.e., they allow Quantcast to track all user activity on the site). Moreover, it is in general agreement with Google Analytics on the user distribution by gender and age.
#* In order to get a clearer sense for the reliability of Quantcast's numbers for your website, you may want to turn on Quantified Measure for your own site so that you can compare those numbers with Google Analytics and verify that they agree where both numbers are available. Note that Quantified Measure also offers demographic information about users, so it might be interesting anyway to sign up for it.
# Below are some approximate benchmarks, based on a mix of data from Quantcast and Google Analytics data that some publishers have chosen to share.
#* Few sites will have more than 95% of their audience of one gender. Partly, this is because even if all their audience were of one gender, Google Analytics would likely misidentify some audience members. Partly, this is because any topics that interests a large number of human beings is likely to interest at least a few human beings of each gender.
#* Perhaps the most extreme gender ratios are seen on websites in the Stack Exchange network for technology communities, with the proportion of males ranging from 90% to 97%. This is because these websites combine two attributes favoring males: they are about technology and programming topics, where males are overrepresented, and they use the Q&A format, which seems to elicit more participation from males.<ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/stackoverflow.com Quantcast report for Stack Overflow, the flagship site of the Stack Exchange network]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/serverfault.com Quantcast report for Server Fault, a site on the Stack Exchange network]</ref>
#* Sports news and hardcore gaming websites are most heavily male-skewed, with the proportion of users that is male usually higher than 80% and possibly even higher than 90%.<ref name=quantcast-rantsports>[https://www.quantcast.com/rantsports.com Quantcast report for Rant Sports]</ref><ref name=quantcast-mmorpg>[https://www.quantcast.com/mmorpg.com Quantcast report for MMORPG]</ref>
#* Pornography websites tend to be male-skewed, but not as heavily as you might naively think. For instance, leading pornography website Pornhub estimates that 24% of their visitors in 2015 were female, and also expects that the percentage of females viewing porn will increase over time.<ref name=pornhub-2015-in-review>[http://www.pornhub.com/insights/pornhub-2015-year-in-review Pornhub’s 2015 Year in Review]</ref>
#* Real-time politics news websites tend to get around 75% to 85% of their traffic from males. This may be attributed partly to the sports-like nature of politics news, and partly to the fact that males are overrepresented in sectors such as politics and government lobbying where people need to keep track of real-time news.<ref name=quantcast-thehill>[https://www.quantcast.com/thehill.com Quantcast report for The Hill, a political news site focused on the United States federal government]</ref><ref name=quantcast-politico>[https://www.quantcast.com/politico.com Quantcast report for Politico,  a political news site focused on the United States federal government]</ref><ref>[https://www.quora.com/Why-does-it-seem-like-women-are-less-interested-in-politics-than-men Why does it seem like women are less interested in politics than men?]</ref>
#* Websites covering political and policy news tend to be male-skewed, though generally less so than the heavily real-time-focused ones. The percentage of males varies between 65% and 85%. The male skew tends to increase with the heterodox nature of the political and policy positions espoused by the website. For instance, policy-focused news and analysis website Vox is 70% male,<ref name=quantcast-vox>[https://www.quantcast.com/vox.com Quantcast report for Vox]</ref> whereas ''Reason'', a libertarian magazine, is 84% male.<ref name=quantcast-reason>[https://www.quantcast.com/reason.com Quantcast report for Reason, a libertarian magazine website]</ref> Conservative news sites also tend to be more heavily male, partly driven by the bias towards older people and the fact that among older age groups, Internet use is more heavily male.<ref name=quantcast-dc>[https://www.quantcast.com/dailycaller.com Quantcast report for The Daily Caller]</ref>
#* Science and technology news websites tend to be moderately male-skewed, with the percentage of audience that is male being between 65% and 85%. Both the science/technology aspect and the news aspect tend to bias in favor of males, though neither bias is very strong.<ref name=quantcast-venturebeat>[https://www.quantcast.com/venturebeat.com Quantcast report for VentureBeat] (VentureBeat is a technology website that focuses on reporting venture deals)</ref><ref name=quantcast-phys>[https://quantcast.com/phys.org Quantcast report on phys.org, a science news website]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/technologyreview.com Quantcast report for Technology Review]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/sciencealert.com Quantcast report for Science Alert]</ref>
#* Mainstream news websites such as CNN and MSNBC are between 60% and 70% male.<ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/msnbc.com Quantcast report for MSNBC]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/cnn.com Quantcast report for CNN]</ref> However, see the next bullet point.
#* Celebrity news, entertainment news, and light-hearted entertainment websites tend to be moderately female-skewed, with the percentage of audience that is female being between 50% and 80%. An example is NBC.com, that is about 60% female.<ref name=quantcast-nbc>[https://www.quantcast.com/nbc.com Quantcast report for NBC]</ref> Another example is Soompi, an English-language website focusing on the happenings in South Korean drama, that trends 80% female.<ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/soompi.com Quantcast report on Soompi]</ref> However, a celebrity news site that focuses more on pictures of scantily clad women, or semi-pornographic material, and less on gossip will tend to be more male-skewed. For instance, a website such as The Chive or Uproxx will be male-skewed,<ref name=quantcast-thechive>[https://www.quantcast.com/thechive.com Quantcast report for The Chive]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/uproxx.com Quantcast report for Uproxx]</ref> whereas a more BuzzFeed-like website (such as Upworthy or LifeBuzz) will be female-skewed.<ref name=quantcast-lifebuzz>[https://www.quantcast.com/lifebuzz.com Quantcast report for LifeBuzz]</ref><ref name=quantcast-upworthy>[https://www.quantcast.com/upworthy.com Quantcast report for Upworthy]</ref>
#* Food consumption websites (not focused on recipes or cooking) can range anywhere from even (50% for each gender) to moderately female skewed (70% female) depending on the type of content.<ref name=quantcast-eater>[https://www.quantcast.com/eater.com Quantcast report for Eater.com]</ref><ref name=quantcast-yelp>[https://www.quantcast.com/yelp.com Quantcast report for Yelp]</ref>
#* Cooking and home furnishing sites are likely to be heavily female-skewed, usually somewhere between 70% and 90% female. The style of the site is an important determinant in how extreme the female skew is.<ref name=quantcast-apartment-therapy>[https://www.quantcast.com/apartmenttherapy.com Quantcast report for Apartment Therapy, a home improvement website]</ref><ref name=quantcast-thekitchn>[https://www.quantcast.com/thekitchn.com Quantcast report for The Kitchn, a recipe website]</ref><ref name=quantcast-ohsheglows>[https://www.quantcast.com/ohsheglows.com Quantcast report for Oh She Glows, a vegan recipe website]</ref>
#* Fashion, style, and beauty sites are likely to be very female-skewed, with the proportion varying between 70% and 90%.<ref name=quantcast-refinery29>[https://www.quantcast.com/refinery29.com Quantcast report for Refinery 29, a fashion website]</ref><ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/thezoereport.com Quantcast report for The Zoe Report, a female-focused fashion and style website]</ref>
#* A good rule of thumb is to look on Quantcast for other websites covering similar topics as yours. It is useful that all the Stack Exchange websites have demographic data available on Quantcast, so those can be used as a benchmark. However, Q&A websites have somewhat of a male bias relative to other websites on the same topics, so you will need to adjust based on that.
# Keep in mind the relative size of the male and female population in your target location and age group.
#* In the United States, the number of male and female Internet users is approximately equal, so for the US as a whole, no adjustment needs to be made. However, in some other countries, such as India, Internet users tend to be disproportionately male (the skew could be partly misleading because of the use of shared computers between family members, that are registered in the name of a male member).<ref>[http://www.statista.com/statistics/272438/gender-distribution-of-internet-users-in-india/ Distribution of internet users in India as of October 2015, by gender]</ref> In this case, rather than just looking at the percentage of users by gender, it is more helpful to look at this percentage adjusted for the overall percentage of Internet users. Quantcast's reports do so and call it an "index"<ref name=quantcast-index/> but Google Analytics does not report this number directly.
#* Different age groups might have different gender distributions of Internet users. In particular, younger age groups are likely to have a closer-to-equal gender ratio, whereas older age groups are more likely to skew male. However, this can vary by location so it's best to look up the data in your target audience.
# Understand the potential for bias arising from your own marketing strategy. 
#* The gender bias could partly be a consequence of your own marketing strategy promoting the content to a particular gender. For instance, let's say you promote it (on Facebook, or by advertising on other websites) to audiences that have been identified as female. Or, you promote it in a forum where the audience is disproportionately female. In that case, you'll find that your website's visitors tend to be female, but this could just be an artifact of your promotion strategy. This creates a self-reinforcing feedback loop, which can lead you to forgo discovering new potential audiences.
#* One way around this is to filter using two dimensions in Google Analytics. For instance, you can filter by gender ''and'' the default channel grouping for referral. This gives you an idea of the proportion of your traffic from each combination of gender and default channel grouping. Take a look at the default channel grouping that is least influenced by your marketing strategy. For instance, if you have put in no direct efforts into search engine optimization targeted at a particular gender, then the proportion for organic search traffic is a better indicator. If you have no site presence on social media, then the proportion on social media is a better indicator.
#* Another way to counter the bias arising from promotion strategies and discovery is to look at users with a large number of pageviews. You can do this by selecting the primary dimension as gender and the secondary dimension as Page Depth. Now, you can see, for each depth, what the relative proportion of male and female users are. If your audience is majority female primarily because of your marketing strategy, but the website itself is not a good fit for females, you should see the relative proportion of male users increase with page depth.
