The page should discuss the history, present use, success rate, how officers think and approach this, any criticism or commentary on it.

The Wikipedia page should discuss the history, what airports currently use it and what ones expansion is being considered to, any TSA or DHS evaluations of security, speed of processing, etc. and general reception and commentary. Please include a mix of official sources (tsa.gov, dhs.gov, airport websites), mainstream news sources, and blogs/websites, esp. travel-focused ones.

* Austin Petersen: $30: Petersen is one of the candidates for the Libertarian Party Presidential Primary, 2016. Petersen has received some coverage in mainstream media sources (e.g. the Washington Post) plus a lot of libertarian-focused media coverage.
