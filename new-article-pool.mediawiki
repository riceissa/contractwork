List of new articles that any interested author can work on. A parenthetical "(reserved)" means that an author has already announced that he or she is working on it. If that author later decides not to continue with it, the page will be returned to the general pool.

== Draft completion ==

Some already existing drafts need a little bit cleanup before they can be published and pushed to the world.

* Research preregistration: $18 for completion: Start from the draft at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Riceissa/Research_preregistration and complete. Work closely under Issa.

== New pages ==

=== Research methods: recruitment, surveys, etc. ===

* Food frequency questionnaire: $25-40: Explain what it is, historical examples, cautionary notes and best practices, results of common FFQs.

* Marlow-Crowne Social Desirability Scale: $20-30: Already mentioned on the social desirability bias, but probably deserves a separate page, detailing the scale, plus discussing existing research on it and its psychometric properties.

=== Global (and national/local) health ===

* Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network: $25-40 (depending on length and quality): It is already mentioned as a single para in the Wikipedia global alert page, but deserves its own page.

* To Save Humanity (reserved by Forrest; no public draft): $25-50 (depending on length and quality): A book published May 2015 with essays on global health. Authors include Bill Gates and Peter Piot.

* Global Programme on AIDS: $30-50 (depending on length and quality): This was run by WHO and was a predecessor to UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. Also, both the new page and the existing page on UNAIDS should clearly describe the relationship between the programs.

* WaitList Zero: $25-50 (depending on length and quality): A charity funded by the Open Philanthropy Project, that advocates for various ways to help people with organ donation and reduce the long wait times in the organ donation market (currently US policy-focused).

=== Philanthropy ===

* Field Foundation (aka Field Foundation of New York, now dead, splinter group Field Foundation of Illinois lives on): $25 (reserved by Devansh; no public draft): Basic article discussing the founding by Marshall Field, other aspects of history, the Richard Boone er, etc. See Holden's reply comment at http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/history-philanthropy-case-study-founding-center-budget-and-policy-priorities

* Richard W. Boone: $30-50 (based on length and quality) (reserved by Devansh; no public draft): This is the guy who played a role as Executive Director of the Field Foundation (of Illinois?). He also appears to have bankrolled the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP).

* Scientific charity movement: $30-50 (depending on length and quality): Somewhat related to Charity Organization Societies (COS) but arguably sufficiently separate/distinctive to deserve a separate page. There was also a "scientific charity" that arose during the US Civil War, that may or may not be related (part of your job will be figuring out the relationship).

* Chicago Community Trust: $25-50 (depending on length and quality) (reserved by Kevin; no public draft): Similar article as Silicon Valley Community Foundation, New York Community Trust, etc. Length may vary heavily based on the number and quality of sources you can find.

=== Machine learning and artificial intelligence ===

Prices not yet determined. Contact to learn more, but generally at least $50 for a well-done piece.

* Timeline of computer chess

* Timeline of text and character recognition (reserved by Michael)

=== Technology/people ===

* Adora Cheung (she was the co-founder and top gun at Homejoy, which shut down): $25

=== Politics ===

(nothing at present, but stay tuned)

=== Torture ===

* Pigeon torture: $25-40: A torture practice in North Korea. Trigger warning.

=== Welfare in the United States ===

* Commodity Supplemental Food Program: $70-120, depending on article quality and length. Maybe even more!

* Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program: $60-110, depending on article quality and length. Maybe even more!

* Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act: $50-90, dependong in article quality and length. Maybe even more!

* Food Assistance for Disaster Relief: $40-70, depending on article quality and length. Maybe even more!

* Nutrition Assistance Block Grants: $40-70, depending on article quality and length. Maybe even more!

=== Taxation ===

* Form 1120: $30 (reserved by Sean): This is the main corporate income tax form in the United States. The analogue of Form 1040 for individuals and Form 990 for nonprofits. Low initial pay because I don't want anything as detailed as Form 990 or 1040 for starters. But more payment possible if you do something more detailed.

* Form 1099-R: $50: Want something of comparable quality to Form 1099-MISC.

* Form 1099-K: $30: Want something of comparable quality to Form 1099-MISC.

* Form 1098: $30: Want something of comparable quality to Form 1099.

* Form 1098-T (reserved by Charlie; public draft available): $30: Want something of comparable quality to Form 1099-MISC.

Also, pages on state-level income tax returns. In general, prioritize the most populous states as listed at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population#States_and_territories . However, note that some states already have their own taxation pages, so be sure to check for those beforehand. Please discuss with Issa or Vipul to get individual price quotes for individual states.

=== Immigration ===

* Stokes interview: $50: A separate interview that a field officer at USCIS conducts of a married couple with one partner seeking permanent residence. This is done after the field officer suspects fraud as a result of a joint interview of the couple. The page should discuss the history, present use, success rate, how officers think and approach this, any criticism or commentary on it.

* Academic Training: $150. This is the analogue for J-1 visas of Optional Practical Training. The full amount is available only if the page has comparable detail to the current page on Optional Practical Training. However, partial pay is possible for a reasonably good article.

* W visa: $125. A proposed new visa, part of various immigration reform proposals, that would be mostly a replacement for the existing H-2 visas. The high pay is mostly because understanding exactly what the proposals would do requires a deeper understanding of existing immigration law, and the politics of changing it. I'm happy to provide guidance to the person who works on this.

=== Other government/bureaucracy ===

* Screening Partnership Program: $35 (reserved for Avi): This is a program where the TSA partners with private operators to carry out screening at airports. The Wikipedia page should discuss the history, what airports currently use it and what ones expansion is being considered to, any TSA or DHS evaluations of security, speed of processing, etc. and general reception and commentary. Please include a mix of official sources (tsa.gov, dhs.gov, airport websites), mainstream news sources, and blogs/websites, esp. travel-focused ones.

* Privacy Impact Assessment: $50: A type of impact assessment conducted by an organization (typically, a government agency or corporation with access to a large amount of sensitive, private data about individuals in or flowing through its system). The organization audits its own processes and sees how these processes affect or might compromise the privacy of the individuals whose data it holds, collects, or processes. PIAs have been conducted by various sub-agencies of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and by many others.

=== Books, orgs, and people ===

* The Entrepreneurial State (reserved for Chris): $30 for a decent job that references reviews at Mises Daily, EconLog, and the ones found at https://artir.wordpress.com/series-de-articulos/ (e.g., https://artir.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/mazzucato-and-the-iphone-ii-the-myth-of-the-entrepreneurial-state/), plus a decent discussion of impact.

* Illiberal Reformers: $30 for a decent job that includes references to various reviews. Has been referenced in EconLog and by Jonh Goldberg, who noted parallels with his own book Liberal Fascism.

* Sheldon Richman: $35: There is already a deleted page on him. You would first need to message the admin who deleted the page to retrieve the existing version. Then work on improving/fixing it, and then republish. Probably not good as a first project. Page needs to survive for at least 30 days after recreation to be eligible for payment.

== Improvements to existing pages ==

=== Health (global and local) ===

* Timeline of deworming: $15-30 (depending on how much extra detail gets added): Add more events related to worm diseases and interventions prior to 1949 for things other than schistosomiasis.

=== International development ===

* Inter-American Development Bank (poverty reduction section): $5-20: Section is currently empty. Between $5 and $20 for expanding the section, based on how much you expand it, and the quality of your expansion.
