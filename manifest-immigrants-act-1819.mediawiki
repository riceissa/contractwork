The regulation of the conditions of sea transportation began in the 19th century, generally before meaningful restrictions on migration were imposed. In the United Kingdom, the first such law was the [[Passenger Act of 1803]]. In addition to its stated purpose of reducing unsafe and uncomfortable journeys, the Act was suspected as a way to control emigration, by making it more expensive for peopleto leave for Canada, where rent was cheaper. The Act was repealed in 1826.

The first regulation of sea transportation in Canada occurred in 1869.
