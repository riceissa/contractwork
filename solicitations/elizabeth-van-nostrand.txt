Hi Elizabeth,

I recently came across your post https://www.facebook.com/li.van.nostrand/posts/10104067284521015 announcing that you are leaving Wave. I'm sad to hear that didn't work out, but I'm also excited to learn that you are interested in doing contract writing and research work. As an occasional reader of your website, I like the quality of your thinking and the diversity of your interests, and I think we could work out a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Over the last couple of years, I've spent about $55,000 in contract work payments for a wide variety of tasks, documented fully at https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com In recent months, most of the focus has been on work building timelines of important stuff at the Timelines Wiki (https://timelines.issarice.com). The goal is to have a thicker and deeper understanding of how history has unfolded on domains of interest. There is substantial overlap with the areas of interest of the effective altruist community, but it's by no means "EA"-exclusive. The timeline format has also attracted Peter Hurford, who's funded $600 in completed or in-process timelines (recorded as part of contractwork.vipulnaik.com).

For instance, to investigate the way malaria has shaped the world, and better inform object-level decisions around donating to charities like the Against Malaria Foundation, we've worked on timelines such as:

https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_malaria
https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_malaria_in_2016
https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_malaria_in_2017
https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_malaria_vaccine
https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_CRISPR
https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_mosquito_net_distribution
https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Against_Malaria_Foundation
https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_The_Global_Fund_to_Fight_AIDS,_Tuberculosis_and_Malaria

If you're interested in contributing to the timelines wiki, I'd be interested in providing funding to cover basic costs of work, similar to the payment for existing timelines (that you can see on individual worker pages e.g. https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Sebastian+Sanchez#workerTaskList). Here are some potential ideas for things you could work on:

- Timeline of Tostan (or any other specific nonprofits you've closely tracked and have good knowledge of)
- Timeline of a specific social phenomenon, such as female circumcision, or a specific scientific or technological breakthrough and its adoption, such as nitrogen fixation
- Timelines related to finance, such as timeline of mobile banking, timeline of international money transfers, timeline of electronic transfers, etc.

These are just beginning ideas, and if you're interested in any of these or anything else, let's talk.
