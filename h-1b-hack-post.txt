<em>This post is part of my "high-skilled hacks" series, focused on immigration to the United States. The series explores various workarounds and caveats to immigration law that high-skilled workers and their employers have discovered in order to further their own interests, at the expense of the original intent of immigration law. Through the series, I try to argue that, although these hacks are an improvement over an alternative where only the basic immigration system existed, freer migration for all would be simpler, fairer, more efficient, and more just. The introductory post of the series is <a href="/blog/high-skilled-hacks-us-immigration-system-needs-refactoring/">here</a>.</em>

<h4>The H-1B: the most important work visa</h4>

The most important source of high-skilled migration to the United States is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa">H-1B visa</a>. The H-1B is significant in at least a few ways:

<ul>
	<li>For many high-skilled workers who enter the United States for work, the H-1B is how they are able to first enter.</li>
	<li>Even those who enter for work in other ways (such as the TN-visa, L-visa, or OPT on F student status) often transition to the H-1B when they get the opportunity.</li>
	<li>While many who come to the US on H-1B status eventually leave, many others settle permanently in the United States. Some do so by applying for permanent residency through one of the EB visas (which has a long wait time, and the H-1B allows them to work as they wait for it to come through). Others find true love among US citizens and permanent residents, marry them, and transition to lawful permanent residency that way.</li>
	<li>Those on the H-1B who do go back to their home countries often play a key role in facilitating technology transfer and outsourcing and the international spread of technology.
</ul>

Later, we'll talk more about why so many people want or need to switch from other temporary work statuses to the H-1B.

There are two other close cousins of the H-1B: the H-1B1 (for Singapore and Chile) and the E-3 (for Australia). We'll mention these briefly as hacks around the H-1B, but cover them in more detail in separate posts.

<h4>Steps to getting into H-1B status</h4>

The following is the sequence of steps for getting H-1B status.

<ul>
	<li>First, the employer files a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Condition_Application">Labor Condition Application</a> with the U. S. Department of Labor, showing that the worker to be hired will be paid the same wage (or a higher wage) than comparable U.S. workers, as well as some other stipulations regarding working conditions, strikes and lockouts (most of which are irrelevant for most employers).</li>
	<li>With an approved LCA and other supporting documentation, the employer files <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_I-129">Form I-129</a> with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a division of the Department of Homeland Security. Approval of this form gives the employee permission to start employment under the employer at or after the start date of employment, and until the end date of employment. The employee must be with the employer for the entire duration of H-1B: even a day of unemployment nullifies H-1B status. The Form I-129 can be filed at most six months in advance. For cap-subject applications, prior to considering a H-1B application, USCIS makes sure that it has space in its annual quota. Since the quotas start every fiscal year (October 1), most H-1B applications occur in the beginning of April and set a start date of October 1.</li>
	<li>With an approved Form I-129, the employee can start work with the employer if present in the United States already (in other words, Form I-129 also allows for change of non-immigrant status; there is no need to file a separate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_I-539">Form I-539</a>). However, if not present in the United States, the employee needs to obtain a H-1B visa from a consular officer at a United States consulate. Consulates are under the U.S. Department of State. After obtaining a visa, the person may enter the United States at most 10 days in advance of the start date of the job. At the port of entry (the airport for people flying in), the person receives a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_I-94">Form I-94</a> from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Field Operations officer (CBP is under the Department of Homeland Security).</li>
</ul>

<h4>H-1B and "permanent" immigration</h4>

There is a lot of confusion about the role played by the H-1B and its relation to Lawful Permanent Resident status (getting a Green Card). H-1B status is a dual-intent non-immigrant status. Let's unpack that. Here, "non-immigrant" means that the status is a temporary status to be in the United States (in this case, for work) and does not provide any automatic path to permanent residency. The "dual-intent" part says that it is okay for a person on H-1B to also be trying to transition to a Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status.

There are two main routes to LPR status (aka "immigrant" status): Employment-based (EB) and family-based (this includes Immediate Relative (IR) and Family (F) statuses). The initial USCIS form for EB statuses (the analogue of Form I-129) is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_I-140">Form I-140</a> and that for F and IR statuses is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_I-130">Form I-130</a>.

One key difference between LPR status and temporary statuses like H-1B is that, <em>once</em> LPR status is obtained, it is no longer necessary to maintain the connection (whether employment-based or family-based) that was the basis of getting the status. In other words, once you have a green card, you can quit the job or divorce the spouse that helped you get the green card. On the other hand, to stay in H-1B status, you need to stay with the employer who is sponsoring you. LPR status <em>can</em> be revoked for various reasons (such as committing crimes or aggravated felonies, or being outside the United States for too long), but maintaining the original reason for acquiring the status is not required. LPR statuses also offer a path to citizenship: somebody who has been a LPR for five or more years can file Form N-400 for naturalization.

Another key difference between LPR status and temporary statuses is the complexity and time taken for the application process. There are actually two aspects to the time taken for this status, that operate in parallel (so the longer of these is the constraining factor). These are:

<ul>
	<li>The processing time for applications: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCIS_processing_times">Processing times</a> for Form I-140 applications can be quite long, varying from 5 months to a year. In addition, some EB categories require a separate process called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_certification">labor certification</a> prior to filing Form I-140. Labor certification is similar to the LCA, but with much more onerous requirements, and can take several months to obtain.</li>
	<li>Independent of this processing time is the time taken for a visa number to be available. Permanent immigration is controlled by a complicated system of quotas introduced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965">Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965</a>, that controls the number of permanent immigration slots that are released every year by the preference category as well as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_of_chargeability">country of chargeability</a>. The queues for these are managed by the Visa Reporting and Control Division and published in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Bulletin">Visa Bulletin</a>. Particularly for large countries like India, China, and Mexico, these categories can be backlogged by over a decade.</li>
</ul>

The reason the total time taken is the maximum rather than the sum of these two wait times is that the priority date (that determines an application's position in queue) is taken as the date the Form I-140 was received (and for applications with labor certification, the date the labor certification petition was received). (Note that the way the caps operate for EB status is different from the way it operates for H-1B: the H-1B quota is reset annually, and applied at the time Form I-129 is adjudicated, whereas the quota for EB status can extend indefinitely and therefore there is no upper limit on how far the backlog can grow).

In addition to the max of these two, there could be some processing time for the Form I-485 (Adjustment of Status application) if the employee is already in the United States in H-1B or another status, or to get an immigrant visa, if the employee is outside the United States. Generally, the processing for the Form I-485 or immigrant visa begins a little before the applicant's priority date becomes current, so that the two finish in parallel.

The upshot of this is that getting an employee on an immigrant status is a process that can take somewhere between several months (if the employee happens to be from a country that doesn't have huge backlogs) to decades (if the employee is from a country with huge backlogs). Regardless of how brilliant the employee is, therefore, this is not a very effective solution for most employers, who are operating at much shorter timescales with respect to their hiring needs. For this reason, even employers who are interested in sponsoring employees for a green card may initially hire them on a H-1B so that the employee can start working for them while the steps to transition to immigrant status are ongoing. This relationship has been implicitly acknowledged with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Competitiveness_in_the_21st_Century_Act">American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act (AC21)</a>, where people with long-pending Form I-140 or Form I-485 applications can extend their H-1B while waiting for it to go through.

When the EB category and the current incarnation of H-1B were first introduced in 1990, the EB category was starting off without backlogs. Hence, those employers who sought workers on a more permanent basis went the EB route, and those who wanted temporary work went the H-1B route. As the EB category started developing backlogs, and demand for high-tech workers increased overall, the pressure on the H-1B status increased. Since it is extremely difficult to adjust the <em>overall</em> quotas of the number of immigration slots, the EB category will likely continue to be severely limited, and the H-1B will continue to be the first step for many workers, including those who qualify for EB status.
 
<h4>Key pieces of legislation that have shaped the H-1B</h4>

Although H visas were originally introduced with the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the H-1B in its current form was introduced only as recently as 1990. There are three landmark pieces of legislation that have shaped the visa category:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1990">Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT)</a>, passed by the 101st United States Congress and signed into law by President George H. W. Bush, introduced the basic rules of the H-1B: a three-year visa that could be extended another three years, an annual cap of 65,000, a Labor Condition Application with rules regarding prevailing wages, and a concept of Specialty Occupation. Surprisingly, every phrase of the preceding sentence continues to describe the H-1B regime today, even though, in practice, a number of hacks have led to far more H-1Bs effectively being available. But more on that later.</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Competitiveness_and_Workforce_Improvement_Act">American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA)</a>, passed by the 105th United States Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on October 21, 1998, offered temporary reprieves from the caps, but otherwise was a victory for restrictionists and advocates of labor.</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Competitiveness_in_the_21st_Century_Act">American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act (AC21)</a>, passed by the 106th United States Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on October 17, 2000, extended some temporary reprieves and introduced a number of hacks that effectively expanded H-1B availability, while offering some minor sops to the other side. These hacks will be discussed later in the piece.</li>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_Visa_Reform_Act_of_2004">H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004</a>, part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Appropriations_Act,_2005">Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005</a>. The main relevant provision here was to add 20,000 slots for people with graduate degrees every year. There were also some changes (in the direction of tightening, but also toward more standardization) to the process for the LCA.</li>
	<li>The H-1B1 (for Singapore and Chile) and E-3 (for Australia) were created as a result of free trade agreements that happened between 2003 and 2005: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore%E2%80%93United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement">Singapore–United States Free Trade Agreement</a> (ratified 2003, effective January 1, 2004), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile%E2%80%93United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement">Chile-United States Free Trade Agreement</a> (ratified 2003, effective January 1, 2004), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia%E2%80%93United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement">Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement</a> (ratified 2004, effective Janaury 1, 2005).</li>
</ul>

Since 2004, there does not appear to have been any new legislation regarding H-1Bs, with a few minor exceptions related to additional fees and attestations:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employ_American_Workers_Act">Employ American Workers Act</a> (signed into law in February 2009 with a two-year sunset provision, not renewed): This basically treated any company that was a recipient of TARP and Federal Reserve Act Section 13 funds as a H-1B-dependent employer for the purposes of the LCA. These employers needed to make the additional attestations required. Once a company had paid back all the funds they were no longer subject to these requirements.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/archive/archive-news/uscis-implements-h-1b-and-l-1-fee-increase-according-public-law-111-230">Public Law 111-230</a>, that imposed an additional fee of $2,000 for H-1B petitions (Form I-129) between August 14, 2010 and September 30, 2014, in cases where employers had more than 50 H-1B workers and more than 50% of their workforce was H-1B workers. These filters were stricter than those for classifying an employer as H-1B-dependent. The fee <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/news/public-law-111-230-h-1b-l-1-additional-fees-expire">has expired</a>.</li>
</ul>

Loosely speaking, the latter half of the H-1B regime (1990-2015) has been legislation-free. Changes have happened, but mostly at an administrative and executive level, with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issuing additional guidance on changing interpretations of existing provisions. This extreme stability is not indicative of anybody being satisfied with the <em>status quo</em> &mdash; there is general consensus within the Beltway that some liberalization in H-1Bs would be desirable. Rather, as I discussed in my <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/high-skilled-hacks-us-immigration-system-needs-refactoring/">introductory post</a>, it's a phenomenon of gridlock: high-skilled immigration is treated as a deal-sweetener that different sides want to tack on to their preferred bills to make them more palatable, but isn't important enough or urgent enough for anybody to pass immediately.

The historical predecessor to the H-1B is important to understand, and we'll probably cover it in our <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/how-did-we-get-here-the-origins-of-immigration-restrictions-intro/">origins of immigration restrictions series</a>. However, for reasons of space and focus, we'll restrict discussion here to the H-1B as it started in 1990.

<h4>The stated purpose, and real uses, of the H-1B</h4>

The stated goal of the H-1B is to temporarily employ foreigners when the supply of skilled workers in the United States falls short of employer needs. In other words, the H-1B is intended as a stop-gap measure to address temporary labor shortages for skilled workers. It is not intended to be a path to permanent migration (for that, there is the EB category, discussed earlier). It is also not meant to be restricted to cases of truly outstanding people (for whom, in addition to the EB-1 category, there is the O-1 category for temporary workers). It is also not intended as a means for technology transfer, i.e., the goal of the H-1B is not to train people for a few years in the United States so that they can return to their home country with increased productivity and better practices. Rather, it is meant to address cases where employers have a temporary need for additional workers and can't find people in the United States fast enough, so they hire people from abroad briefly, and then once the supply of workers in the U.S. catches up, they don't replace them. This stated goal of the H-1B is the justification for a fee on H-1B applications (of $750 or $1500 depending on the employer's size) whose funds are used for improving science education and workforce training in the United States.

In the real world, employers don't use the H-1B in that way. There are two broad kinds of use cases for the H-1B:

<ul>
	<li>The most quantitatively significant (accounting for about half of H-1B use) is mid-level technology employees by large multinational technology/software firms to which other firms outsource their work. The Economic Policy Institute (a think tank that advocates the interests of labor, stereotypically construed) <a href="http://www.epi.org/blog/top-10-h1b-guestworker-offshore-outsourcing/">notes that</a> the top ten users of the H-1B program, that account for half of H-1B use in the United States, all fit in this framework: Cognizant, Tata, Infosys, Wipro, Accenture, HCL America, Tech Mahindra SATYAM, IBM & IBM India, Larsen & Toubro, and Deloitte. Many of these have either their roots or significant operations in India, and that is a big part of how half of new H-1Bs are granted to people from India. Most of these workers don't go on to transition to LPR status. Partly, this is because they don't qualify for the higher bar set for EB status. Their short-term employment in the US office allows them to take back relevant technology and skills to their home countries.</li>
	<li>The other use case is various technology firms in various sectors (programming in Silicon Valley, banking, quantitative finance) that need to hire workers. There are two main ways that these companies connect with the H-1B workers to fill these positions: some of the workers completed higher education in the United States and get on the job market at the end of their higher education. Others may be hired by the company at an office in another country and then transferred to the United States office (for instance, Google or Microsoft might hire a worker in Bangalore or Hyderabad, and when the worker later gets promoted or moved to a division in the company that is only at the company's main headquarters in Mountain View or Redmond, sponsors a H-1B for the worker). The business model of the hiring companies is not built around the workers returning to their home countries; in fact, the hope is that the workers will be able to stay in the United States for as long as necessary. Many of these employees may later be sponsored for EB status if they are considered sufficiently valuable to the company. A good summary of this use case, in contrast with the preceding one, can be found on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/five-firms-get-more-than-1-4-h-1b-visas-john-a-byrne">LinkedIn</a>.</li>
</ul>

While the first use case has been decried (by the EPI as linked above, and by <a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/h1b.html">others</a>) for the way technology transfer contributes to more offshoring of jobs, the second use case has been decried for creating more <em>permanent</em> competition in the market for skilled labor, leading to lower wages and reduced incentives for Americans to enter these sectors. With that said, not all critics of H-1B programs are critical of both kinds of use cases. Some people, like current U.S. Republican Presidential primary leader Donald Trump as well as <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/paul-graham-us-immigration-policy-high-tech-programmers/">Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham</a>, are critical of the first use case of the H-1B but supportive of the second.


<h4>How does the H-1B compare with other options?</h4>

There are a number of alternatives to the H-1B, but none of them are good enough to render the H-1B unimportant. What the alternatives do help with is, in many cases, reducing the "pressure" on H-1B somewhat. So if you're a H-1B applicant, you might want to thank the many other alternative visas for taking some of the competition out.

<ul>
	<li>The L visas are visas available to multinationals that allow them to transfer people working for the same company but in another country.

<em>Advantages</em>: Fewer restrictions on the type of occupation and educational qualifications, longer period (7 for the L-1A and 5 for the L-1B, as opposed to 3 + 3 for the H-1B.

<em>Disadvantages</em>: Only available to multinational companies, which excludes many technology companies, particularly the smaller ones.

Microsoft has been known to use L visas creatively: it first gets people to Canada on a work visa, whereby they can visit the Redmond office (in the United States, close to Seattle, Washington close to the Canadian border) with relative ease, and eventually transfers them over to the Redmond office.

You can see more detailed comparisons <a href="http://www.immi-usa.com/immigration-news/l1-versus-h1b-visas/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.immihelp.com/l1-visa/l1-visa-h1b-visa-comparison.html">here</a>.</li>
	<li>The TN-1 status for Canadians, and a similar but somewhat more restrictive TN-2 status for Mexicans, allows people from these countries to work in the US in renewable 3-year increments.

<em>Advantages</em>: The TN-1 for Canadians is uncapped, and can in principle be renewed many many times.

<em>Disadvantages</em>: The set of occupations that are eligible for TN-1 is narrower than for H-1B. For instance, Computer Systems Analysts are TN-eligible, but mere computer programmers aren't. The application and renewal process for TN-1 is also less standardized, and even though multiple renewals are possible in principle, renewals are often rejected for unclear reasons.

You can see more detailed comparisons <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/h-1b-tn-visa-which-should-canadian-mexican-choose.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.tnvisabulletin.com/tn-vs-h-1b-visa-chart/">here</a>.</li>
	<li>O ("Outstanding") visas are available to "aliens of extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts (including television and motion pictures), business or athletics."

<em>Advantages</em>: No caps, unlike the annual 65,000 visa cap for H-1B. Also, students and exchange visitors who came to the United States on J status can get an O-1 visa but cannot apply for the H or L visa without completing the 2-year foreign residence requirement.

<em>Disadvantages</em>: More documentation and proof needed of extraordinary ability, with a particular focus on credentialism and formal academic accomplishment. This makes many people ineligible. Many star programmers, who might command several hundred thousand dollars in salary, may not be able to qualify for this visa.

You can see more detailed comparisons <a href="http://blog.wegreened.com/blog-articles/the-o-1-visa-as-an-alternative-to-h-1b/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.hooyou.com/o-1/whynot.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

For better or worse, the majority of high-skilled immigrant workers and companies sponsoring them use the H-1B despite the uncertainty of the application process, largely because it has a relatively large quota, relatively low burdens of proof, and accessibility to people who don't have a lot of bureaucratically determined academic credentials as well as to companies that aren't multinationals with deep pockets.
