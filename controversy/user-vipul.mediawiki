__INDEX__
Hi!

This is Vipul Naik. I completed my B.Sc. (Hons) in Mathematics at the [[Chennai Mathematical Institute]] in [[Siruseri]] which is just off [[Chennai]], [[India]] and my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the [[University of Chicago]]. I currently work in a mixed data science, programming, and customer success role at [http://www.liftigniter.com/ LiftIgniter], a machine learning/data science startup in [[San Francisco]]. My website is [http://vipulnaik.com vipulnaik.com]. All edits I make are in my personal capacity and not on behalf of any of the aforementioned organizations.

For more on my Wikipedia editing, see [http://vipulnaik.com/wikipedia/ my site page about Wikipedia], [http://vipulnaik.com/sponsored-wikipedia-editing/ my site page about sponsored Wikipedia editing], and [http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultipleyears.php?tag=Pages%20created%20by%20Vipul%20Naik the list of all pages I have created, with pageviews across the years].

== Other account with about two dozen edits ==

I recently noticed that I have another account [[User:Vipulnaik|Vipulnaik]] with about two dozen edits, mostly before 2014, and since then, all on mobile devices. After looking into it a bit more, I discovered that this account got created as part of my global Wikimedia account (the global account with username Vipul wasn't available). I didn't intend to use this account for editing the English Wikipedia, but a few times (probably after I uploaded pictures to Commons) I accidentally made edits through this account.

I also appear to have logged in using this account on my phone a few times, so some mobile edits show up as being from this account.

== Sponsored Wikipedia editing ==

I have been running an experiment with sponsored Wikipedia editing since April 2015. As of March 8, 2017, I am suspending this operation, pending review of it at [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest/Noticeboard|COIN]] and [[Wikipedia:Administrators' Noticeboard/Incidents|ANI]]. I will update this page if and when the status changes.

For a most up-to-date list of people I have sponsored to create Wikipedia content, and links to the specific pieces of work I have sponsored, see [https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork this repository] or [https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com this portal]. Most specifically, [https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/venue.php?venue=Wikipedia&matching=exact this page] lists all sponsored Wikipedia editing tasks that I have paid for, along with various types of summary information.

You might also be interested in [[User:Riceissa|Issa Rice]], one of the people who makes edits and improvements to Wikipedia, some of which I pay for. You can also see [https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/contributor-lists/issa-list.mediawiki my payment list to him] (or a [http://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Issa+Rice more information-rich version thereof]).

== Permission to cite and reference (in on-Wikipedia discussions) any stuff published under my name off-wiki ==

You have permission to reference and quote any content published by me, that is identified as being by me in any of the following ways:

* Any publicly accessible activity by me using my [https://www.facebook.com/vipulnaik.r Facebook account] (this includes public posts and comments on others' public posts)
* Any content under the domain vipulnaik.com or any of its subdomains (including contractwork.vipulnaik.com)
* Any content in GitHub repositories under [https://github.com/vipulnaik my account]
* Any content I published on these online venues: LessWrong with username [http://lesswrong.com/user/VipulNaik/ VipulNaik], Effective Altruism Forum with username [http://effective-altruism.com/user/vipulnaik/ vipulnaik], Open Borders: The Case with username [http://openborders.info/blog/author/vipulnaik/ vipulnaik], and Quora with username [https://www.quora.com/profile/Vipul-Naik Vipul Naik]. You can also use any of the accounts I list as mine on the [https://vipulnaik.com/connect/ connect page] on my website.

The content under these accounts may not reflect my current views, but I will not consider it outing of my identity if you reference or link to any of this material.

If you find other online content that you think might be by me but aren't sure, please feel free to reach out to me on-wiki or off-wiki (via email at vipulnaik1@gmail.com or on Facebook) to confirm.

This is to address concerns people might have with [[WP:OUTING|OUTING]] when discussing my off-wiki content in connection with my on-wiki activity.

== List of people I've paid ==

Note that I am not responsible for all edits of these people. The links below provide context on what edits I've paid for -- you should not assume that any edit by somebody in this list was requested or paid for by me.

To get a combined list of all Wikipedia contributions across all workers, see [https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/venue.php?venue=Wikipedia&matching=exact here].

You can cross-check this list against the programmatically generated list [https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/#paymentsDueByWorkerAndType here].

== List of pages I have explicitly sponsored creation of or contributions to ==

Note that this list does not include pages edited by me, and does not list me as a contributor even if I have edited the page. It also does not list edits made to the pages by people I pay, if I did not pay them. The list includes all edits I've paid for, including private ones.

To obtain more details on individual pieces of work funded, completion date, and payment, see [https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/venue.php?venue=Wikipedia&matching=exact here].

Note that the edits I sponsored may not show up in the most recent revision of the page, and some pages where I sponsored edits may have been deleted, merged, or redirected.

All timeline articles are mirrored at (and will be improved at) the [https://timelines.issarice.com timelines wiki]. This includes, but is not limited to, the timelines that have been deleted.

Some other content is mirrored [https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/wikipedia/ here] and [https://github.com/riceissa/issarice.com/tree/master/external/en.wikipedia.org here]; however, these mirrors may not be up to date.
