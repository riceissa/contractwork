Inlinetext says "removal of my COI warnings is a serious breach of FTC regulations" on [[Talk:Parker_Conrad]].  Is this a legal threat?  The "paid editors" he is talking about were paid by someone doing philanthropic work simply to improve the quality of certain articles.  Doc James was in contact with Vipul (see Vipul's talk page) and everything seems to be in order. [[User:Jrheller1|Jrheller1]] ([[User talk:Jrheller1|talk]]) 19:59, 3 March 2017 (UTC)
:I don't know that it is. Possibly. I need more context pertaining to the dispute (with links). In theory, s/he is quoting from [[m:Terms_of_use/FAQ_on_paid_contributions_without_disclosure|m:ToU]]—but did you remove COI warnings? And if so, why? I read [[User_talk:Vipul#Paid_editing_2|Vipul on paid editing]] and I am afraid that I am not seeing how it directly connects to this dispute. Nor do I understand what this dispute is even about.  [[User:El_C|El_C]] 20:31, 3 March 2017 (UTC)
:: See Inlinetext's comments on [[Talk:Parker_Conrad]].  He (just guessing gender) is falsely claiming that there were "unlawful" paid edits on the page.  According to the link Inlinetext provided [https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Alex+K.+Chen], an editor was paid a 25$ bounty by Vipul Naik for improving the page (which obviously is not illegal editing on behalf of a corporation). [[User:Jrheller1|Jrheller1]] ([[User talk:Jrheller1|talk]]) 20:42, 3 March 2017 (UTC)
:::I had already read that talk page—who removed COI notices, where & when? And why? I need details. Perhaps Inlinetext can better explain this [[User_talk:Inlinetext#Weighing_in|him or herself]]. [[User:El_C|El_C]] 20:50, 3 March 2017 (UTC)
:::: Inlinetext deleted more than half the page (and placed the COI notice based on the false claim of illegal paid editing) and I reverted his edits (all within the last few days).  I'm interpreting his edits as a more sophisticated than usual type of vandalism.  [[User:Jrheller1|Jrheller1]] ([[User talk:Jrheller1|talk]]) 21:04, 3 March 2017 (UTC)
:::::In order: '''1.''' Removed more than half-of-what page? ([[Parker Conrad]]?) '''2.''' Placed COI notice on which page? '''3.''' And you had removed said notice why? [[User:El_C|El_C]] 21:18, 3 March 2017 (UTC)
:::::: Yes, the page in question is Parker Conrad (for both deletions and COI notice).  I removed it because there was no improper paid editing and this user has done the same sort of thing on multiple previous occasions.  For example, he falsely accused the primary author of [[Geodesics on an ellipsoid]] of copyright violation (while deleting more than half of the [[Geodesics on an ellipsoid]] article and also placing a copyright violation template on the page).   [[User:Jrheller1|Jrheller1]] ([[User talk:Jrheller1|talk]]) 21:26, 3 March 2017 (UTC)
:::::::Fair enough, though you've been light on evidence. (Personally, I like [[WP:DIFF|diff]]s.) But did the COI notice intimate ''improper'' paid editing or just paid editing? This is where evidence comes in. I'd still like to learn his or her side of it before rendering a decision. [[User:El_C|El_C]] 21:40, 3 March 2017 (UTC)
:::::::Oh, this is from the AN3 report I closed(!)—I didn't clue into that (I close a few). Now I'm remembering more. Anyway, I left Inlinetext [[User_talk:Inlinetext#Parker_Conrad_and_BLP|another note]]. [[User:El_C|El_C]] 01:11, 4 March 2017 (UTC)
{{od}}I am busy in real life for 2 days (48 hours). If you want, I will assemble some diffs before the 5 days page protection expires. I mention, in passing, that it is incorrect to say I "removed" more than half of [[Parker Conrad]]. The page history will show that I made a series of edits, each with detailed edit summaries explaining my objections to specific portions of text on that page. 'Jrheller1' consistently refuses to discuss content issues with me and simply reverts all my edits either without comment or by describing them as 'vandalism'. I don't see how setting out, during discussion in a content dispute, the relevant operative portion of the WMFs official FAQ on paid editing constitutes any kind of legal threat. Since the sum involved for the paid edits promoted by [[User:Vipul]] are not insignificant and run into tens of thousands of dollars, well exceeding the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Long-term_abuse/Orangemoody Orange Moody paid editing scandal] I am of the view that the case of [[User:Vipul]] and his extensive network of paid edits /editors must be investigated and dealt with by the Foundation because the [[Parker Conrad]] article is stated by [[User:Vipul]] to be first paid article of this "worker" who has thereafter received over $10,000 for paid editing from Vipul. Incidentally, I am not the only editor who has problems with Vipul and his network of meats, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vipul&oldid=767404357#Conflict_of_interest link] for extensive edits in September 2013 to [[Bryan Caplan]] with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bryan_Caplan&action=historysubmit&type=revision&diff=574899818&oldid=574826646 meat-puppetry by Simfish]. Eventually [[User:Id4abel]] cleaned up the Bryan Caplan article in much the same way as I did [[Parker Conrad]]. I also make the point that ''Jrheller1'' is yet to explain his past edit history at Wikipedia. He is clearly an expert editor in the maths domain [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deriving_the_Schwarzschild_solution&diff=prev&oldid=696775355 first edit of Jrheller1] like [[User:Vipul]] is. This entire episode is very troublng and it is best handled by the Foundation and not on just one Administrator's talk page since it may be the tip of a larger paid editing scandal than OrangeMoody. I am also not clear why Doc James' input is relevant considering that he was removed from WMF's BoT and does not speak for the Foundation.[[User:Inlinetext|Inlinetext]] ([[User talk:Inlinetext|talk]]) 04:21, 4 March 2017 (UTC)
:Thanks for the explanation. Those levels of payments, if true, are indeed disconcerting. But what about my questions no. 1 and 2? I am the protecting admin, so for better or worse, I am administratively involved (for) now. But by all means, feel free to contact the Wikimedia Foundation at: https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Contact_us  [[User:El_C|El_C]] 04:37, 4 March 2017 (UTC)
::As I mentioned I am busy IRL. I am  very clear in my understanding of Q1 and Q2 but would like to properly frame my response, eg in terms of ToU issues transcending local community policies / guidelines and failed drafts. The $10,000+ is the payment to just one editor 'Simfish'. You can see an example of another of Vipul's paid meats [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive947#Ethanbas ANI final warning]. It is clear that Vipul is paying some highly abusive and troublesome editors for some as yet undisclosed agenda. Will consider approaching WMF if this matter cannot be resolved within the community by discussion. [[User:Inlinetext|Inlinetext]] ([[User talk:Inlinetext|talk]]) 05:18, 4 March 2017 (UTC)
:::[[User:Ethanbas|Ethanbas]], really? Interesting. Fair enough, take your time. [[User:El_C|El_C]] 05:23, 4 March 2017 (UTC)
::::Hello everybody! I see my paid editing has been discussed here, so I wanted to clarify a few things: (1) The figure of $10,000 for Simfish (real name: Alex K. Chen) includes all work he has done; if you restrict only to Wikipedia editing and related payments the amount is closer to $6400. A full breakdown is available [https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Alex+K.+Chen here]. (2) I don't control all edits by people I pay; the edit war and controversy that Ethanbas (real name: Ethan Bashkansky) got into were of his own volition and not paid for or otherwise requested by me. I did privately dissuade him from warring, and will continue to offer him candid feedback on the subject, but I don't control all his actions. Also note that most of the articles for which he got into edit fights were ones I am not paying for, but ones he created because he has become excited about contributing to Wikipedia (admittedly, his ''initial'' foray into contributing to Wikipedia was through paid work for me, but he's now editing it a lot of his own volition). (3) I don't know who Jrheller1 is (it's possible it is somebody who knows me, but I don't recognize the handle, and I haven't been in communication with this person). You can get a full list of the people I have paid for edits (with one exception, who requested the payment be made private, but this person has edited only one page and has not been part of any controversy) at [https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com contractwork.vipulnaik.com]. Every editor who does paid work for me is required to disclose the fact on his or her talk page and link to my list of the worker's contributions and their payments. (4) Calling paid editors "meats" is disrespectful and misleading. I'm fully transparent about the work I fund, including revealing the real names and full identity (including social media identity and email addresses) of all workers, and all amounts paid (with one small exception as noted above). (5) My motives are pretty plainly stated at [https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com contractwork.vipulnaik.com] and the articles I wrote that I linked at the top.[[User:Vipul|Vipul]] ([[User talk:Vipul|talk]]) 08:08, 4 March 2017 (UTC)

{{od}}Thanks for joining us Vipul. I'm between meetings right now, so this is just a brief note to say that I am interested in carrying this discussion forward. 'Simfish' (who BTW doesn't conspicuously publish his paid editing affiliations) just happened to open his "bounty" account by creating an excessively NPOV/one-sided, puffed up and badly sourced article in May 2015 on the CEO of this startup which was then awash in scandal for (i) cutting corners aggresively in its regulatory duties in a highly regulated environment [https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/09/utah-state-legislators-vote-yes-in-support-of-zenefits-operations-in-the-state/ Feb 2015], (ii) aggressively stealing customers and being "[http://fortune.com/2015/06/30/zenefits-human-resources-software/ banned, demonized, and sued]" across the US and (iii) carrying on a massive public relations blitz to keep the unicorn afloat and investors coming in, happened to get only US$25 for a Wikipedia article on its founder who exited with a $10 million "bounty" after being [https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/80-of-zenefits-deals-in-washington-state-done-by-unlicensed#.laQA2aEJg "found"] operating with 80+% of its employees unlicenced ? Excuse me while I laugh. This is not the first time Wikipedia has been used for 'pump and dump' operations and there are even some "badsites" which document those events in painstaking detail with diffs and which is why the applicable jurisdiction has regulators, like FTC, which WMF takes pains to obey.<br /> '''Q1.''' Can you explain why the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parker_Conrad&oldid=662101190 article version you personally signed off on] for Simfish's bounty doesn't have a hint of any of the well known troubles then surrounding Conrad's company or Conrad ?  (and which troubles only escalated from that point forward). [[User:Inlinetext|Inlinetext]] ([[User talk:Inlinetext|talk]]) 13:10, 4 March 2017 (UTC)
: Hi inlinetext, glad to see your response. I find it unfortunate that you're so suspicious of my work despite the radical transparency I (and my workers) have practiced. Let me try to address your concerns. First, a little bit of historical context. [[User:Simfish|Simfish]] has been editing Wikipedia since the mid-2000s, but stopped working on Wikipedia in the last few years. In 2015, I approached Simfish with the idea of using some of his spare time to add content to Wikipedia. We were still figuring out exactly how payment and incentives might work to better meet my goal of promoting Wikipedia as a good source of knowledge. At that early stage (when both he and I were still figuring things out) I wanted to encourage him to create longer, more detailed articles. Of the articles he initially created, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parker_Conrad&oldid=661902490 initial Parker Conrad article] (or maybe look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parker_Conrad&oldid=662091501 this version] which is the state of the article after his last edit) was the first one that was not terribly stubby, and in order to encourage him to create more content of at least that length, I awarded him $25. As you can see from [https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Alex+K.+Chen#workerTaskList here] this is marked as an "accidental/retroactive bounty", i.e., it wasn't an article I told him to create, but one I paid him for after he created it. Subsequent to that, both he and I improved our standards a lot, as you can see by looking at the later works he did for me, and the work I've gotten from other contract workers since then. Now, regarding omissions from that initial article he wrote, it's likely that he and I did not do as much research on the subject as we should have (and if I was funding an article like that now, I would push for more research). I don't think the troubles around Zenefits were that widely known at the time. Definitely, when I had created the Zenefits article on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zenefits&oldid=643493795 January 21, 2015], I had tried to get all the public information on Zenefits and hadn't come across a mention of these troubles. When Simfish created the Parker Conrad article, I didn't re-research the subject but simply relied on my memory of the situation from January when I had written the original Zenefits article, so therefore I missed any more recent controversies. However, I should note that even Simfish's short initial particle on Parker Conrad did include at least one negative thing about him -- his rejection of an employee who asked a Quora question -- which I think should address accusations of it being puffery. Neither he nor I (nor anybody else paid or instigated by me) have edited or otherwise interfered with the content of the Parker Conrad article after his initial edits in May. In fact, until yesterday, I wasn't even aware of the huge controversy surrounding the article's current state. I'm glad to see that the Zenefits and Parker Conrad articles that we created in 2015 (when the company was still looking like a fast riser) have evolved over time to reflect the controversies at the company. The continued evolution of Wikipedia articles to reflect changing realities excites me, and I'm proud that the initial content that I created (with the Zenefits article) and that Simfish created (with the Parker Conrad article) have been the starting point for this evolution.[[User:Vipul|Vipul]] ([[User talk:Vipul|talk]]) 17:56, 4 March 2017 (UTC)
: I also wanted to address your question about whether Simfish has clearly disclosed his paid editing. It is true that at the time of the Parker Conrad article the information was not explicitly disclosed on his user page, partly because there were some aspects of policy we weren't fully aware of. On [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Simfish&direction=prev&oldid=732445705 July 11, 2015] he added the disclosure. In subsequent edits on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Simfish&direction=next&oldid=671002294 August 1, 2016] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Simfish&direction=next&oldid=732445705 January 18, 2017], we added links to more detailed coverage of the paid edits, to make it easier for people to understand the details behind each individual payment. I find it unfortunate that people who hide behind pseudonyms, failing to disclose real-world identity, continue to attack us for being transparent about our real-world identity and full details of the work we are doing. It concerns me that this creates few incentives for others to follow in our footsteps in revealing information about themselves, for fear that it would open them up to unfair attacks and accusations.[[User:Vipul|Vipul]] ([[User talk:Vipul|talk]]) 18:08, 4 March 2017 (UTC)
::Thanks, I have read it carefully, but the great and scattered detail of your reply engenders some additional '''preliminary''' queries /doubts for me.[[User:Inlinetext|Inlinetext]] ([[User talk:Inlinetext|talk]]) 18:52, 4 March 2017 (UTC)

'''Q2.''' Is it correct that your network of paid editors involves / envisages multiple levels of membership and (some of) your team members receive commissions for recruiting other members and also a percentage calculated on income of other members below (or after) them ?[[User:Inlinetext|Inlinetext]] ([[User talk:Inlinetext|talk]]) 18:52, 4 March 2017 (UTC)

: Yes; however, I would not consider this a hierarchy but rather simply different kinds of payments for faciliating various parts of the process. For more context: in mid-2016, I was seeking to significantly scale up Wikipedia editing work, but the people I currently had on board did not have enough time to do enough work to meet my ambitions. Given my more-than-full-time day job, and my lack of a network with potential editors, I sought the help of some of these people to recruit others. I wanted recruitment incentives that would encourage them to find people who would do a lot of work. Therefore, I had a deal with [[User:Ethanbas|Ethanbas]] where I pay him a commission (usually 10%) of the work of people he recruits. I also pay [[User:Riceissa|Riceissa]] a similar commissions for all recently recruited editors; in turn he helps review their work and push for better quality and standards, while also guiding them on Wikipedia norms.[[User:Vipul|Vipul]] ([[User talk:Vipul|talk]]) 19:15, 4 March 2017 (UTC)

'''Q3.''' Is it correct that the income you / your network receives or distributes is linked to Wikipedia page views. I ask since your github pages report page view statistics quite prominently.[[User:Inlinetext|Inlinetext]] ([[User talk:Inlinetext|talk]]) 18:52, 4 March 2017 (UTC)

: I have experimented with pageviews-based payment for some editors (you can see these payments listed as "royalties" e.g. at the bottom of [https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Alex+K.+Chen this page]). The initial idea here was to encourage people to create content that was important to end users without me needing to micromanage the content creation. This worked reasonably well but over time I found that I was more interested in paying for direct work on articles than based on pageviews. Starting 2017, I have discontinued pageview-based payments for Simfish. My two most prolific current editors, [[User:Riceissa|Riceissa]] and [[User:Wikisanchez|Wikisanchez]] (in terms of edits I pay for, not including other edits they make of their own volition), as well as [[User:JesseClifton|JesseClifton]], a former prolific editor, did not receive any pageview-based payments. The main reason we report pageviews prominently is that it's something that the people I pay, as well as others who look at the contract work we do, are interested in. It gives people a sense of greater accomplishment and provides them feedback on (one measure of) the impact they are having. It also helps third parties better gauge the work we are doing.[[User:Vipul|Vipul]] ([[User talk:Vipul|talk]]) 19:15, 4 March 2017 (UTC)

'''Q4.''' Is there any particular reason that 'Simfish' declares his COI so inconspicuously at the very end of his user page ?[[User:Inlinetext|Inlinetext]] ([[User talk:Inlinetext|talk]]) 18:52, 4 March 2017 (UTC)

: You'll have to ask him that! I sent him a private message alerting him to this thread (since I'm not sure he checks Wikipedia notifications).[[User:Vipul|Vipul]] ([[User talk:Vipul|talk]]) 19:15, 4 March 2017 (UTC)

'''Q5''' Is there any reason why your voluntary reports are not uploaded to Wikimedia servers but to 3rd party server accounts under your control ?[[User:Inlinetext|Inlinetext]] ([[User talk:Inlinetext|talk]]) 18:52, 4 March 2017 (UTC)

: The payment system setup is pretty complicated (I initially managed them as text files in a git repository, but then moved to a fuller accounting system which took me a couple of weekends to code up -- you can see the [https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/commits/ commit history of the repository]). It's hard enough to get the whole thing set up on a personal server that I control; coordinating with a third party to host it (particularly when I am not aware of any existing system to upload this information) seems even harder. However, I welcome any third-party mirrors. The [https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/LICENSE.txt license] for the repository allows for such mirroring.[[User:Vipul|Vipul]] ([[User talk:Vipul|talk]]) 19:15, 4 March 2017 (UTC)
